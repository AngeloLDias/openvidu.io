            "text": "What is OpenVidu?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu is a platform to facilitate the addition of video calls in your web or mobile \napplication, either group or one-to-one calls. In fact, any combination you come up with is easy to implement with OpenVidu.\n\n\nOpenVidu is licensed under \nApache License v2\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhat can I do with OpenVidu?\n\n\nYou can add video-call functionalities to your app, among many other things. The process is really simple: OpenVidu offers all the necessary services and tools. You just need to integrate them in your app to start enjoying its benefits: \n\n\n\n\nOne-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many calls\n\n\nDecide which user can publish and which can't with predefined roles\n\n\nSend audio + video, audio-only or video-only streams\n\n\nBroadcast text messages\n\n\nMute any track whenever you want\n\n\nShare your screen\n\n\nRecord your videocalls\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what about adding a video-call center for attending your customers face to face? Or maybe you are developing an application to hold meetings via videoconference. Or you are thinking about teachers streaming to all their students within online lessons, or doctors communicating with their patients with a human touch. The possibilities are endless.\n\n\nYou can check our \nDemos\n to get an idea of what you can do with OpenVidu. Here are some cool pictures of them:\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Architecture\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu is divided into two parts:\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Browser\n: it is a library to use in your client side (available for JavaScript and TypeScript). It allows you to create video-calls, join users to them, send and receive video and audio, etc... All the actions available with OpenVidu are managed via OpenVidu Browser.\n\n\nOpenVidu Server\n: it is an application that handles the server-side stuff. It receives the operations from OpenVidu Browser and do whatever is necessary to establish and manage your video-calls. You will never have to explicitly use it: just to run it and know its IP address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet started\n\n\nThese are the recommended steps for getting started with OpenVidu:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best way to get your first app working in a few minutes is following our \nOpenVidu Hello Word Tutorial\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, you can try any of our \nClient-Side-Only\n tutorials, or maybe go straight to step 3 if you think that you already handle OpenVidu reasonably well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry now any of our \nClient-Side + Server-Side\n tutorials, where you can see how a complete web application works with OpenVidu. Choose your preferred framework, since all 4 applications are exactly the same regarding their look and functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally you can \ndeploy your first app\n and see it working in the real world. You can follow our tutorial, where you can deploy our Demos in your own Amazon machine in a few minutes (\nDeploying OpenVidu Demos on AWS\n). Then you can deploy your own app following these steps (\nDeploying OpenVidu Server and your app on AWS\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does OpenVidu work?\n\n\nWebRTC\n is the ultimate responsible for all media transmission at the very heart of OpenVidu. WebRTC is a modern, cross-platform framework that democratizes media transmission over the Internet. It is promoted by Google, Mozilla, Opera and others.\n\n\nKurento\n is the WebRTC framework on which OpenVidu is built. Openvidu was forked from \nKurentoRoom project\n.\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the differences between Kurento and OpenVidu?\n\n\nOpenVidu wraps and hides all the low-level operations. The main goal we pursue is to provide a simple, effective, easy-to-use API so you can forget about WebRTC, ICE candidates and media server tricky stuff. We internally use Kurento to generate, connect, modify and destroy media-pipelines, but OpenVidu simplifies as far as possible the process, focusing on the use-case of video-call sessions (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, users with different roles).\n\n\nUltimately, developers can create video-calls with just a few lines of code, all from their client-side\n.\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\nOpenVidu has been supported under Project LERNIM (RTC-2016-4674-7), co-funded by the \nMinistry of Economy, Finance and Competitiveness\n of Spain, as well as by the \nEuropean Regional Development Fund\n, whose main goal is to promote technological development, innovation and high-quality research.\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery-wellcome\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $('.docs-gallery').slick({\n      autoplay: true,\n      autoplaySpeed: 4000,\n      dots: true,\n      infinite: true,\n      pauseOnHover: false,\n      pauseOnFocus: false,\n      responsive: [\n      {\n        breakpoint: 768,\n        settings: {\n          arrows: false,\n          slidesToShow: 1\n        }\n      },\n    ]\n    });",

It has only 4 files:\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-webcomponent-{VERSION}.js\n: JavaScript file of OpenVidu Web Component. You don't have to manipulate this file.\n\n\nopenvidu-webcomponent-{VERSION}.css\n: styles for OpenVidu Web Component. You don't have to manipulate this file.\n\n\napp.js\n: sample application main JavaScript file.\n\n\nindex.html\n: HTML code of the application.\n\n\n\n\nLet's see how OpenVidu Web Component works:\n\n\n\n\nindex.html\n\n\nInside of the \nhead\n section of \nindex.html\n, we reference our \napp.js\n script and \nopenvidu-webcomponent\n files:\n\n\nhead\n\n\n    \n!--... other imports ...--\n\n\n    \nscript src=\napp.js\n/script\n\n    \nscript src='openvidu-webcomponent-{VERSION}.js'\n/script\n\n    \nlink rel=\nstylesheet\n href=\nopenvidu-webcomponent-{VERSION}.css\n\n\n/head\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the \nindex.html\n body has the form to connect to a video-session and the \nOpenVidu Web Component\n, which starts hidden:\n\n\nbody\n\n\n    \n!-- Form to connect to a video-session --\n\n    \ndiv id=\nmain\n style=\ntext-align: center;\n\n        \nh1\nJoin a video session\n/h1\n\n        \nform onsubmit=\njoinSession(); return false\n style=\npadding: 80px; margin: auto\n\n            \np\n\n                \nlabel\nSession:\n/label\n\n                \ninput type=\ntext\n id=\nsessionName\n value=\nSessionA\n required\n\n            \n/p\n\n            \np\n\n                \nlabel\nUser:\n/label\n\n                \ninput type=\ntext\n id=\nuser\n value=\nUser1\n required\n\n            \n/p\n\n            \np\n\n                \ninput type=\nsubmit\n value=\nJOIN\n\n            \n/p\n\n        \n/form\n\n    \n/div\n\n\n    \n!-- OpenVidu Web Component --\n\n    \nopenvidu-webcomponent style=\ndisplay: none;\n/openvidu-webcomponent\n\n\n\n/body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\napp.js (I): OpenVidu Web Component events\n\n\nOpenVidu Web Component emits events \njoinSession\n, \nleaveSession\n or \nerror\n, so we can handle them in our JavaScript code.\nWe just need to get the element once the document is ready and add all the listeners we want:\n\n\n$(document).ready(() =\n {\n    var webComponent = document.querySelector('openvidu-webcomponent');\n\n    webComponent.addEventListener('joinSession', (event) =\n {\n        // Do something\n    });\n    webComponent.addEventListener('leaveSession', (event) =\n {\n        // Do something\n    });\n    webComponent.addEventListener('error', (event) =\n {\n        // Do something\n    });\n});\n\n\n\n\nIn this tutorial, we just alternate the view between the form and the web component, hiding or showing them when receiving \njoinSession\n or \nleaveSession\n events.\n\n\n\n\napp.js (II): Configuring OpenVidu Web Component\n\n\nMethod \njoinSession()\n gets:\n\n\n\n\nThe form input values, with the video-call to connect and the nickname the user will have in it.\n\n\nThe \ntoken\n from OpenVidu Server. Check out \nnext point\n to see how this is done.\n\n\n\n\nWhen we have our token available, the only thing left to do is to give the desired configuration to openvidu-webcomponent. To do so we use an object with three parameters: \nsessionName\n, \nuser\n and \ntoken\n.\n\n\n\n\nsessionName\n: the session name that will be displayed inside the component\n\n\nuser\n: the nickname that the user will have in the session\n\n\ntoken\n: the retrieved token from OpenVidu Server\n\n\n\n\nfunction joinSession() {\n    var sessionName = document.getElementById('sessionName').value;\n    var user = document.getElementById('user').value;\n\n    getToken(sessionName).then((token) =\n {\n        var webComponent = document.querySelector('openvidu-webcomponent');\n        webComponent.sessionConfig = { sessionName, user, token };\n    });\n}\n\n\n\n\nThat's it. Once you configure the token into the webcomponent, it will automatically join the proper session (\njoinSession\n event will be dispatched so you can update your web). The user will see in the webcomponent all other users joined to the same session and will publish the webcam. You have a video-call working!\n\n\n\n\nGet a \ntoken\n from OpenVidu Server\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \nWARNING\n: This makes this tutorial an insecure application. We need to ask OpenVidu Server for a user token in order to connect to our session. \nThis process should entirely take place in our server-side\n, not in our client-side.

Here we have implemented the POST requests to OpenVidu Server in a method \ngetToken()\n that returns a Promise with the token. Without going into too much detail, this method performs two \najax\n requests to OpenVidu Server, passing OpenVidu Server secret to authenticate them:\n\n\n\n\nFirst ajax request performs a POST to \n/api/sessions\n (we send a \ncustomSessionId\n field to name the session with our \nsessionName\n value retrieved from HTML input)\n\n\nSecond ajax request performs a POST to \n/api/tokens\n (we send a \nsession\n field to assign the token to this same session)\n\n\n\n\nYou can inspect this method in detail in the \nGitHub repo\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra features of OpenVidu Web Component\n\n\nAlternatives to connect to OpenVidu session\n\n\nIn the example above, \nOpenVidu Web Component\n receives the \nsessionConfig\n parameter dynamically like this: \n\n\nwebComponent.sessionConfig = { sessionId, user, token };\n\n\n\n\nBut you can also set them statically, for example if you are building your template in the backend:\n\n\nopenvidu-webcomponent session-config='{\nsessionName\n:\nSessionA\n, \nuser\n:\nUser1\n, \ntoken\n: \nTOKEN_RETRIEVED_FROM_OPENVIDU_SERVER\n}'\n/openvidu-webcomponent\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you want to let the webcomponent get the token for you, you can just dispense with the token and provide two more attributes to it. This is only meant for developing purposes, as you need to hardcode the secret of your OpenVidu Server in the JavaScript code:\n\n\nopenvidu-webcomponent session-config='{\nsessionName\n:\nSessionA\n, \nuser\n:\nUser1\n}'\nopenvidu-server-url=\nhttps://localhost:4443\n openvidu-secret=\nMY_SECRET\n/openvidu-webcomponent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \nWARNING\n: As you can see, when you add parameters to OpenVidu web component statically, you have to replace the \ncamelCase\n with a \nhyphen between words\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose the session dynamically\n\n\nYou can also disconnect the user from the session assigning dynamically \nundefined\n to the \nsessionConfig\n property :\n\n\nov.sessionConfig = undefined;\n\n\n\n\nChoose a theme\n\n\nOpenVidu  allows you to choose between two themes.

This method returns a Promise to which you can subscribe to.\n\n\nIn case of success we first set the view to the active video session. Then we proceed to publish our webcam. To do so we just get a \npublisher\n using \nOpenVidu.initPublisher\n method, and a new HTML video showing our webcam will be appended to the page inside element with id \n\"publisher\"\n.\n\n\nLast but not least, we publish this \npublisher\n object thanks to \nsession.publish\n. At this point the rest of users connected to this session will trigger their own \nstreamCreated\n event and can start watching our webcam.\n\n\n\n\nLeaving the session:\n\n\nsession.disconnect();\n\n\n\n\nWhenever we want a user to leave the session, we just need to call \nsession.disconnect\n method. Here it will be called inside \nleaveSession\n function, triggered when the user clicks on \"LEAVE\" button. This function also returns the page to the \"Join session\" view.",

HTML videos are automatically removed from DOM\n    removeUserData(event.stream.connection);\n});\n\n\n\n\nHere we subscribe to the events that interest us. In this case, we want to receive all videos published to the session, as well as displaying every user's nickname next to its video. To achieve this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstreamCreated\n: for each new Stream received by OpenVidu, we immediately subscribe to it so we can see its video. A new HTML video element will be appended to element with id 'video-container'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvideoElementCreated\n: event triggered by Subscriber object (returned by the previous \nSession.subscribe\n method). This allows us to add the participant nickname to the new video previously added in \nstreamCreated\n event. Auxiliary method \nappendUserData\n is responsible for appending a new paragraph element just below the \nevent.element\n video, containing \nsubscriber.stream.connection.data\n field. In this case, this field contains the user's nickName. You can see how to feed this property from the client in a later step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstreamDestroyed\n: for each Stream that has been destroyed (which means a user has left the video-call), we remove the element with the user's nickname that we added in the previous event with the auxiliary method \nremoveUserData\n (\nappendUserData\n method created the element with an \nid\n containing \nevent.stream.connection.connectionId\n unique value, so we can now identify the right element to be removed). OpenVidu automatically deletes the proper video element by default, so we don't need to do anything else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck \nApplication specific methods\n section to see all the auxiliary methods used in this app\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet a \ntoken\n from OpenVidu Server\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \nWARNING\n: This is why this tutorial is an insecure application.

Remember \nvideoElementCreated\n event for the Subscriber object, when we added the user's nickname to the HTML? Well, second parameter is the actual value every user will receive in \nStream.connection.data\n property in that event. So in this case it is an object with a property \"clientData\" with value \"myUserName\", which has been set in the first step to the value retrieved from HTML input \ninput class=\"form-control\" type=\"text\" id=\"userName\" required\n (this is filled by the user).\n\n\nIf the method succeeds, we first change our view to the active call (5) and then proceed to publish our webcam to the session. To do so we get a \nPublisher\n object with the desired properties (6). This process will end with the addition of a new HTML video element showing your camera, as a child of element with \nid\n 'video-container'.

In this case, we want to receive all videos published to the session, as well as displaying every user's nickname next to its video. To achieve this:    streamCreated : for each new Stream received by OpenVidu, we immediately subscribe to it so we can see its video. A new HTML video element will be appended to element with id 'video-container'.    videoElementCreated : event triggered by Subscriber object (returned by the previous  Session.subscribe  method). This allows us to add the participant nickname to the new video previously added in  streamCreated  event. Auxiliary method  appendUserData  is responsible for appending a new paragraph element just below the  event.element  video, containing  subscriber.stream.connection.data  field. In this case, this field contains the user's nickName. You can see how to feed this property from the client in a later step.    streamDestroyed : for each Stream that has been destroyed (which means a user has left the video-call), we remove the element with the user's nickname that we added in the previous event with the auxiliary method  removeUserData  ( appendUserData  method created the element with an  id  containing  event.stream.connection.connectionId  unique value, so we can now identify the right element to be removed). OpenVidu automatically deletes the proper video element by default, so we don't need to do anything else.

If the method succeeds, we first change our view to the active call (5) and then proceed to publish our webcam to the session. To do so we get a  Publisher  object with the desired properties (6). This process will end with the addition of a new HTML video element showing your camera, as a child of element with  id  'video-container'. Event  videoElementCreated  will be fired by the Publisher object just after this video is added to DOM, so we can subscribe to it and do whatever we want with it.

Finally, \nmySessionId\n and \nmyUserName\n params simply represent the video-call and your participant's nickname, as you will see in a moment.\n\n\n\n\nWhenever a user clicks on the submit input defined in \napp.component.html\n, \njoinSession()\n method is called:\n\n\n\n\nWe first get an OpenVidu object and initialize a Session object with it.\n\n\n// --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object ---\n\nthis.OV = new OpenVidu();\n\n// --- 2) Init a session ---\n\nthis.session = this.OV.initSession();\n\n\n\n\nThen we subscribe to the Session events that interest us.\n\n\n// --- 3) Specify the actions when events take place in the session ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nthis.session.on('streamCreated', (event: StreamEvent) =\n {\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it. Second parameter is undefined\n    // so OpenVidu doesn't create an HTML video by its own\n    let subscriber: Subscriber = this.session.subscribe(event.stream, undefined);\n    this.subscribers.push(subscriber);\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nthis.session.on('streamDestroyed', (event: StreamEvent) =\n {\n\n    // Remove the stream from 'subscribers' array\n    this.deleteSubscriber(event.stream.streamManager);\n});\n\n\n\n\nAs we are using Angular framework, a good approach for managing the remote media streams is to loop across an array of them, feeding a common component with each \nSubscriber\n object and let it manage its video. This component will be our \nUserVideoComponent\n. To do this, we need to store each new Subscriber we received in array \nsubscribers\n (of the parent class \nStreamManager\n), and we must remove from it every deleted subscriber whenever it is necessary. To achieve this, we use the following events:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstreamCreated\n: for each new Stream received by the Session object, we subscribe to it and store the returned Subscriber object in our \nsubscribers\n array. Method \nsession.subscribe\n has \nundefined\n as second parameter so OpenVidu doesn't insert and HTML video element in the DOM on its own (we will use the video element contained in one of our child components). HTML template of \nAppComponent\n loops through \nsubscribers\n array with an \nngFor\n directive, declaring a \nUserVideoComponent\n for each subscriber. We feed them not really as \nSubscriber\n objects, but rather as their parent class \nStreamManager\n. This way we can reuse \nUserVideoComponent\n to also display our \nPublisher\n object (that also inhertis from class StreamManager). \nuser-video\n also declares the \nclick\n event so we can update the main video player view when the user clicks on its Publisher or any Subscriber videos.\n\n\ndiv *ngFor=\"let sub of subscribers\" class=\"stream-container col-md-6 col-xs-6\"\n\n    \nuser-video [streamManager]=\"sub\" (click)=\"updateMainStreamManager(sub)\"\n/user-video\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstreamDestroyed\n: for each Stream that has been destroyed from the Session object (which means a user has left the video-call), we remove the associated Subscriber from \nsubscribers\n array, so Angular will automatically delete the required UserVideoComponent from HTML. Each Stream object has a property \nstreamManager\n that indicates which Subscriber or Publisher owns it (in the same way, each StreamManager object also has a reference to its Stream).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet a \ntoken\n from OpenVidu Server\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \nWARNING\n: This is why this tutorial is an insecure application. We need to ask OpenVidu Server for a user token in order to connect to our session. \nThis process should entirely take place in our server-side\n, not in our client-side. But due to the lack of an application backend in this tutorial, the Angular front itself will perform the POST operations to OpenVidu Server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// --- 4) Connect to the session with a valid user token ---\n\n// 'getToken' method is simulating what your server-side should do.\n// 'token' parameter should be retrieved and returned by your own backend\nthis.getToken().then(token =\n {\n    // See next point to see how to connect to the session using 'token'\n});\n\n\n\n\nNow we need a token from OpenVidu Server. In a production environment we would perform this operations in our application backend, by making use of the \nAPI REST\n, \nOpenVidu Java Client\n or \nOpenVidu Node Client\n. Here we have implemented the POST requests to OpenVidu Server in a method \ngetToken()\n that returns a Promise with the token, using \n@angular/http\n library. Without going into too much detail, this method performs two POST requests to OpenVidu Server, passing OpenVidu Server secret to authenticate them:\n\n\n\n\nFirst request performs a POST to \n/api/sessions\n (we send a \ncustomSessionId\n field to name the session with our \nmySessionId\n value retrieved from HTML input)\n\n\nSecond request performs a POST to \n/api/tokens\n (we send a \nsession\n field to assign the token to this same session)\n\n\n\n\nYou can inspect this method in detail in the \nGitHub repo\n.\n\n\n\n\nFinally connect to the session and publish your webcam:\n\n\n // --- 4) Connect to the session with a valid user token ---\n\n// 'getToken' method is simulating what your server-side should do.\n// 'token' parameter should be retrieved and returned by your own backend\nthis.getToken().then(token =\n {\n\n    // First param is the token got from OpenVidu Server. Second param can be retrieved by every user on event\n    // 'streamCreated' (property Stream.connection.data), and will be appended to DOM as the user's nickname\n    this.session.connect(token, { clientData: this.myUserName })\n        .then(() =\n {\n\n            // --- 5) Get your own camera stream ---\n\n            // Init a publisher passing undefined as targetElement (we don't want OpenVidu to insert a video\n            // element: we will manage it on our own) and with the desired properties\n            let publisher: Publisher = this.OV.initPublisher(undefined, {\n                audioSource: undefined, // The source of audio. If undefined default microphone\n                videoSource: undefined, // The source of video. If undefined default webcam\n                publishAudio: true,     // Whether you want to start publishing with your audio unmuted or not\n                publishVideo: true,     // Whether you want to start publishing with your video enabled or not\n                resolution: '640x480',  // The resolution of your video\n                frameRate: 30,          // The frame rate of your video\n                insertMode: 'APPEND',   // How the video is inserted in the target element 'video-container'\n                mirror: false           // Whether to mirror your local video or not\n            });\n\n            // --- 6) Publish your stream ---\n\n            this.session.publish(publisher);\n\n            // Set the main video in the page to display our webcam and store our Publisher\n            this.mainStreamManager = publisher;\n            this.publisher = publisher;\n        })\n        .catch(error =\n {\n            console.log('There was an error connecting to the session:', error.code, error.message);\n        });\n});\n\n\n\n\nIn \nsession.connect\n method first param is the recently retrieved user token. Second param is the value every user will receive in \nevent.stream.connection.data\n property on \nstreamCreated\n event (this value will be used by \nUserVideoComponent\n to append the user's nickname to the his video). So in this case it is an object with a property \"clientData\" with value \"myUserName\", which is binded from HTML input \ninput class=\"form-control\" type=\"text\" id=\"userName\" name=\"userName\" [(ngModel)]=\"myUserName\" required\n (filled by the user).\n\n\nIf the method succeeds, we proceed to publish our webcam to the session. To do so we get a \nPublisher\n object with the desired properties and publish it to the Session through \nSession.publish()\n method. The rest of users will receive our Stream object and will execute their \nstreamCreated\n event. Finally we make the main video player (which is just another \nUserVideoComponent\n) display the Publisher object by default. This is the HTML code that will display the main stream manager:\n\n\ndiv *ngIf=\nmainStreamManager\n id=\nmain-video\n class=\ncol-md-6\n\n    \nuser-video [streamManager]=\nmainStreamManager\n/user-video\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we store the Publisher under \nthis.publisher\n, which is also of parent class \nStreamManager\n. This way our webcam will be appended along all remote subscribers, in exactly the same way they are shown (remember all of them are displayed by \nUserVideoComponent\n):\n\n\ndiv *ngIf=\npublisher\n class=\nstream-container col-md-6 col-xs-6\n\n    \nuser-video [streamManager]=\npublisher\n (click)=\nupdateMainStreamManager(publisher)\n/user-video\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that every \nuser-video\n component for our Publisher and every Subscriber also updates the main video player when clicking on it.\n\n\nLast point worth considering is the implementation of \nUserVideoComponent\n and \nOpenViduVideoComponent\n. Each \nUserVideoComponent\n manages one StreamManager object (a Subscriber or a Publisher) that will be fed to its child component \nOpenViduVideoComponent\n. Its main task is not managing the final video player (that is \nOpenViduVideoComponent\n responsibility), but displaying custom information for each one of them (the user's nickname in this case):\n\n\ndiv\n\n    \nov-video [streamManager]=\nstreamManager\n/ov-video\n\n    \ndiv\np\n{% raw %}{{getNicknameTag()}}{% endraw %}\n/p\n/div\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nexport class UserVideoComponent {\n\n    @Input()\n    streamManager: StreamManager;\n\n    getNicknameTag() { // Gets the nickName of the user\n        return JSON.parse(this.streamManager.stream.connection.data).clientData;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nOpenViduVideoComponent\n html template is just the video element:\n\n\nvideo #videoElement\n/video\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the unique responsibility of the component's logic is letting OpenVidu know the exact HTML DOM video player associated to its StreamManger. To do so we use method \nStreamManager.addVideoElement\n, which receives a native HTML video element. The way we implement this is Angular dependant: we get the video element with \n@ViewChild\n tag and we call the method once after the view has initialized (\nngAfterViewInit\n) and once every time the StreamManager input changes (\nset\n method with \n@Input\n tag)\n\n\nexport class OpenViduVideoComponent implements AfterViewInit {\n\n    @ViewChild('videoElement') elementRef: ElementRef;\n\n    _streamManager: StreamManager;\n\n    ngAfterViewInit() {\n        this._streamManager.addVideoElement(this.elementRef.nativeElement);\n    }\n\n    @Input()\n    set streamManager(streamManager: StreamManager) {\n        this._streamManager = streamManager;\n        if (!!this.elementRef) {\n            this._streamManager.addVideoElement(this.elementRef.nativeElement);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaving the session:\n\n\nWhenever we want a user to leave the session, we just need to call \nsession.disconnect\n method in \napp.component.ts\n:\n\n\n  leaveSession() {\n\n    // --- 7) Leave the session by calling 'disconnect' method over the Session object ---\n\n    if (this.session) { this.session.disconnect(); };\n\n    // Empty all properties...\n    this.subscribers = [];\n    delete this.publisher;\n    delete this.session;\n    delete this.OV;\n    this.generateParticipantInfo();\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

This is the HTML code that will display the main stream manager:  div *ngIf= mainStreamManager  id= main-video  class= col-md-6 \n     user-video [streamManager]= mainStreamManager /user-video  /div   And we store the Publisher under  this.publisher , which is also of parent class  StreamManager . This way our webcam will be appended along all remote subscribers, in exactly the same way they are shown (remember all of them are displayed by  UserVideoComponent ):  div *ngIf= publisher  class= stream-container col-md-6 col-xs-6 \n     user-video [streamManager]= publisher  (click)= updateMainStreamManager(publisher) /user-video  /div   You can see that every  user-video  component for our Publisher and every Subscriber also updates the main video player when clicking on it.  Last point worth considering is the implementation of  UserVideoComponent  and  OpenViduVideoComponent . Each  UserVideoComponent  manages one StreamManager object (a Subscriber or a Publisher) that will be fed to its child component  OpenViduVideoComponent . Its main task is not managing the final video player (that is  OpenViduVideoComponent  responsibility), but displaying custom information for each one of them (the user's nickname in this case):  div \n     ov-video [streamManager]= streamManager /ov-video \n     div p {% raw %}{{getNicknameTag()}}{% endraw %} /p /div  /div   export class UserVideoComponent {\n\n    @Input()\n    streamManager: StreamManager;\n\n    getNicknameTag() { // Gets the nickName of the user\n        return JSON.parse(this.streamManager.stream.connection.data).clientData;\n    }\n}  OpenViduVideoComponent  html template is just the video element:  video #videoElement /video   And the unique responsibility of the component's logic is letting OpenVidu know the exact HTML DOM video player associated to its StreamManger. To do so we use method  StreamManager.addVideoElement , which receives a native HTML video element. The way we implement this is Angular dependant: we get the video element with  @ViewChild  tag and we call the method once after the view has initialized ( ngAfterViewInit ) and once every time the StreamManager input changes ( set  method with  @Input  tag)  export class OpenViduVideoComponent implements AfterViewInit {\n\n    @ViewChild('videoElement') elementRef: ElementRef;\n\n    _streamManager: StreamManager;\n\n    ngAfterViewInit() {\n        this._streamManager.addVideoElement(this.elementRef.nativeElement);\n    }\n\n    @Input()\n    set streamManager(streamManager: StreamManager) {\n        this._streamManager = streamManager;\n        if (!!this.elementRef) {\n            this._streamManager.addVideoElement(this.elementRef.nativeElement);\n        }\n    }\n}",

It contains one \nOpenViduVideoComponent\n, the name of the user and also handles a click event to update the view of \nAppComponent\n.\n\n\nOpenViduVideoComponent\n: defines \nOpenViduVideoComponent\n, which wraps the final HTML \nvideo\n that finally displays the media stream.\n\n\n\n\nLet's see first how \nApp.js\n uses NPM package \nopenvidu-browser\n:\n\n\n\n\nWe import the necessary objects from \nopenvidu-browser\n:\n\n\nimport { OpenVidu } from 'openvidu-browser';\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp.js\n declares the following properties in the state:\n\n\n//These properties are in the state's component in order to re-render the HTML when the values of them change\nthis.state = {\n    mySessionId: 'SessionA',\n    myUserName: 'Participant' + Math.floor(Math.random() * 100),\n    session: undefined,\n    mainStreamManager: undefined, // Main video of the page, will be 'publisher' or one of the 'subscribers',\n    publisher: undefined,\n    subscribers: [],\n};\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu\n object will allow us to get a \nSession\n object, which is declared just after it. \npublisher\n will be our own local webcam stream and \nsubscribers\n array will store the active streams of other users in the video-call. Finally, \nmySessionId\n and \nmyUserName\n params simply represent the video-call and your participant's nickname, as you will see in a moment.\n\n\n\n\nWhenever a user clicks on the submit input defined in \nApp.js\n template, \njoinSession()\n method is called:\n\n\n\n\nWe first get an OpenVidu object and initialize a session property in a state.\n\n\n// --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object ---\n\nthis.OV = new OpenVidu();\n\n// --- 2) Init a session ---\n\nthis.setState({\n    session: this.OV.initSession(),\n    }, () =\n {\n        // See next step\n    }\n);\n\n\n\n\nThen we subscribe to the Session events that interest us.\n\n\n// --- 3) Specify the actions when events take place in the session ---\n\n\nvar mySession = this.state.session;\n\n    // On every new Stream received...\nmySession.on('streamCreated', (event) =\n {\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it. Second parameter is undefined\n    // so OpenVidu doesn't create an HTML video by its own\n    var subscriber = mySession.subscribe(event.stream, undefined);\n\n    //We use an auxiliar array to push the new stream\n    var subscribers = this.state.subscribers;\n\n    subscribers.push(subscriber);\n\n    // Update the state with the new subscribers\n    this.setState({\n        subscribers: subscribers,\n    });\n});\n\n    // On every Stream destroyed...\nmySession.on('streamDestroyed', (event) =\n {\n    event.preventDefault();\n\n    // Remove the stream from 'subscribers' array\n    this.deleteSubscriber(event.stream.streamManager);\n});\n\n// See next step\n\n\n\n\nHere we subscribe to the Session events that interest us. As we are using React framework, a good approach for managing the remote media streams is to loop across an array of them, feeding a common component with each \nSubscriber\n object and let it manage its video. This component will be our \nUserVideoComponent\n. To do this, we need to store each new Subscriber we received in array \nsubscribers\n, and we must remove from it every deleted subscriber whenever it is necessary. To achieve this, we use the following events:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstreamCreated\n: for each new Stream received by the Session object, we subscribe to it and store the returned Subscriber object in our \nsubscribers\n array. Method \nsession.subscribe\n has \nundefined\n as second parameter so OpenVidu doesn't insert and HTML video element in the DOM on its own (we will use the video element contained in one of our child components).  HTML template of \nAppComponent\n will show the new video, as it contains a .map js function, declaring a \nUserVideoComponent\n for each subscriber. We feed them not really as \nSubscriber\n objects, but rather as their parent class \nStreamManager\n. This way we can reuse \nUserVideoComponent\n to also display our \nPublisher\n object (that also inhertis from class StreamManager).\n\n\n{this.state.subscribers.map((sub, i) =\n (\n    \ndiv key={i} className=\"stream-container col-md-6 col-xs-6\"\n\n        \nUserVideoComponent streamManager={sub} mainVideoStream={this.handleMainVideoStream} /\n\n    \n/div\n\n))}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstreamDestroyed\n: for each Stream that has been destroyed from the Session object (which means a user has left the video-call), we remove the associated Subscriber from \nsubscribers\n array, so React will automatically delete the required UserVideoComponent from HTML. Each Stream object has a property \nstreamManager\n that indicates which Subscriber or Publisher owns it (in the same way, each StreamManager object also has a reference to its Stream).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet a \ntoken\n from OpenVidu Server\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \nWARNING\n: This is why this tutorial is an insecure application. We need to ask OpenVidu Server for a user token in order to connect to our session. \nThis process should entirely take place in our server-side\n, not in our client-side. But due to the lack of an application backend in this tutorial, the Angular front itself will perform the POST operations to OpenVidu Server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// --- 4) Connect to the session with a valid user token ---\n\n// 'getToken' method is simulating what your server-side should do.\n// 'token' parameter should be retrieved and returned by your own backend\nthis.getToken().then(token =\n {\n    // See next point to see how to connect to the session using 'token'\n});\n\n\n\n\nNow we need a token from OpenVidu Server. In a production environment we would perform this operations in our application backend, by making use of the \nAPI REST\n, \nOpenVidu Java Client\n or \nOpenVidu Node Client\n. Here we have implemented the POST requests to OpenVidu Server in a method \ngetToken()\n that returns a Promise with the token, using \naxios\n library. Without going into too much detail, this method performs two POST requests to OpenVidu Server, passing OpenVidu Server secret to authenticate them:\n\n\n\n\nFirst request performs a POST to \n/api/sessions\n (we send a \ncustomSessionId\n field to name the session with our \nmySessionId\n value retrieved from HTML input)\n\n\nSecond request performs a POST to \n/api/tokens\n (we send a \nsession\n field to assign the token to this same session)\n\n\n\n\nYou can inspect this method in detail in the \nGitHub repo\n.\n\n\n\n\nFinally connect to the session and publish your webcam:\n\n\n // --- 4) Connect to the session with a valid user token ---\n\n// 'getToken' method is simulating what your server-side should do.\n// 'token' parameter should be retrieved and returned by your own backend\nthis.getToken().then(token =\n {\n\n    // First param is the token got from OpenVidu Server. Second param can be retrieved by every user on event\n    // 'streamCreated' (property Stream.connection.data), and will be appended to DOM as the user's nickname\n    mySession.connect(token, { clientData: this.state.myUserName })\n        .then(() =\n {\n\n            // --- 5) Get your own camera stream ---\n\n            // Init a publisher passing undefined as targetElement (we don't want OpenVidu to insert a video\n            // element: we will manage it on our own) and with the desired properties\n            let publisher: Publisher = this.OV.initPublisher(undefined, {\n                audioSource: undefined, // The source of audio. If undefined default microphone\n                videoSource: undefined, // The source of video. If undefined default webcam\n                publishAudio: true,     // Whether you want to start publishing with your audio unmuted or not\n                publishVideo: true,     // Whether you want to start publishing with your video enabled or not\n                resolution: '640x480',  // The resolution of your video\n                frameRate: 30,          // The frame rate of your video\n                insertMode: 'APPEND',   // How the video is inserted in the target element 'video-container'\n                mirror: false           // Whether to mirror your local video or not\n            });\n\n            // --- 6) Publish your stream ---\n\n            mySession.publish(publisher);\n\n            // Set the main video in the page to display our webcam and store our Publisher\n            this.setState({\n                mainStreamManager: publisher,\n                publisher: publisher,\n            });\n        })\n        .catch(error =\n {\n            console.log('There was an error connecting to the session:', error.code, error.message);\n        });\n});\n\n\n\n\nIn \nmySession.connect\n method first param is the recently retrieved user token. Second param is the value every user will receive in \nevent.stream.connection.data\n property on \nstreamCreated\n event (this value will be used by \nUserVideoComponent\n to append the user's nickname to the his video). So in this case it is an object with a property \"clientData\" with value \"myUserName\", which is binded from HTML input \ninput className=\"form-control\" type=\"text\" id=\"userName\" value={myUserName} onChange={this.handleChangeUserName} required /\n (filled by the user).\n\n\nIf the method succeeds, we proceed to publish our webcam to the session. To do so we get a \nPublisher\n object with the desired properties and publish it to the Session through \nSession.publish()\n method. The rest of users will receive our Stream object and will execute their \nstreamCreated\n event. Finally we make the main video player (which is just another \nUserVideoComponent\n) display the Publisher object by default. This is the HTML code that will display the main stream manager:\n\n\n{this.state.mainStreamManager !== undefined ? (\n    \ndiv id=\nmain-video\n className=\ncol-md-6\n\n        \nUserVideoComponent streamManager={this.state.mainStreamManager} /\n\n    \n/div\n\n) : null}\n\n\n\n\nAnd we store the Publisher under \nthis.state.publisher\n, which is also of parent class \nStreamManager\n. This way our webcam will be appended along all remote subscribers, in exactly the same way they are shown (remember all of them are displayed by \nUserVideoComponent\n):\n\n\n{this.state.publisher !== undefined ? (\n    \ndiv className=\nstream-container col-md-6 col-xs-6\n\n        \nUserVideoComponent streamManager={this.state.publisher}\n         mainVideoStream={this.handleMainVideoStream} /\n\n    \n/div\n\n) : null}\n\n\n\n\nLast point worth considering is the implementation of \nUserVideoComponent\n and \nOpenViduVideoComponent\n. Each \nUserVideoComponent\n manages one StreamManager object (a Subscriber or a Publisher) that will be fed to its child component \nOpenViduVideoComponent\n. Its main task is not managing the final video player (that is \nOpenViduVideoComponent\n responsibility), but displaying custom information for each one of them (the user's nickname) and handling the click event on them to update property \nmainStreamManager\n of parent \nAppComponent\n:\n\n\ndiv className=\nstreamcomponent\n onClick={this.handleVideoClicked}\n\n    \nOpenViduVideoComponent streamManager={this.props.streamManager} /\n\n    \ndiv\np\n{this.getNicknameTag()}\n/p\n/div\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nexport default class UserVideoComponent extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n\n        this.handleVideoClicked = this.handleVideoClicked.bind(this);\n    }\n\n    getNicknameTag() {\n        // Gets the nickName of the user\n        return JSON.parse(this.props.streamManager.stream.connection.data).clientData;\n    }\n\n    handleVideoClicked(event) {\n        // Triggers event for the parent component to update its main video display (other UserVideoComponent)\n        if (this.props.mainVideoStream) {\n            this.props.mainVideoStream(this.props.streamManager);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nOpenViduVideoComponent\n html template is just the video element:\n\n\nvideo autoPlay={true} ref={this.videoRef} /\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the unique responsibility of the component's logic is letting OpenVidu know the exact HTML DOM video player associated to its StreamManger. To do so we use method \nStreamManager.addVideoElement\n, which receives a native HTML video element. The way we implement this is React Refs: we get the video element with \nReact.createRef()\n and we call the method once after the component output has been rendered to the DOM (\n \ncomponentDidMount\n \n).\n\n\nexport default class OpenViduVideoComponent extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n\n        this.videoRef = React.createRef();\n    }\n\n    componentDidMount() {\n        if (this.props \n !!this.videoRef) {\n            this.props.streamManager.addVideoElement(this.videoRef.current);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaving the session:\n\n\nWhenever we want a user to leave the session, we just need to call \nsession.disconnect\n method in \nApp.js\n:\n\n\n  leaveSession() {\n\n    // --- 7) Leave the session by calling 'disconnect' method over the Session object ---\n\n    const mySession = this.state.session;\n\n    if (mySession) {\n        mySession.disconnect();\n    }\n\n    // Empty all properties...\n    this.OV = null;\n    this.setState({\n         mySessionId: 'SessionA',\n        myUserName: 'Participant' + Math.floor(Math.random() * 100),\n        session: undefined,\n        mainStreamManager: undefined,\n        publisher: undefined,\n        subscribers: [],\n    });\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

Second param is the value every user will receive in  event.stream.connection.data  property on  streamCreated  event (this value will be used by  UserVideoComponent  to append the user's nickname to the his video). So in this case it is an object with a property \"clientData\" with value \"myUserName\", which is binded from HTML input  input className=\"form-control\" type=\"text\" id=\"userName\" value={myUserName} onChange={this.handleChangeUserName} required /  (filled by the user).  If the method succeeds, we proceed to publish our webcam to the session. To do so we get a  Publisher  object with the desired properties and publish it to the Session through  Session.publish()  method. The rest of users will receive our Stream object and will execute their  streamCreated  event. Finally we make the main video player (which is just another  UserVideoComponent ) display the Publisher object by default. This is the HTML code that will display the main stream manager:  {this.state.mainStreamManager !== undefined ? (\n     div id= main-video  className= col-md-6 \n         UserVideoComponent streamManager={this.state.mainStreamManager} / \n     /div \n) : null}  And we store the Publisher under  this.state.publisher , which is also of parent class  StreamManager . This way our webcam will be appended along all remote subscribers, in exactly the same way they are shown (remember all of them are displayed by  UserVideoComponent ):  {this.state.publisher !== undefined ? (\n     div className= stream-container col-md-6 col-xs-6 \n         UserVideoComponent streamManager={this.state.publisher}\n         mainVideoStream={this.handleMainVideoStream} / \n     /div \n) : null}  Last point worth considering is the implementation of  UserVideoComponent  and  OpenViduVideoComponent . Each  UserVideoComponent  manages one StreamManager object (a Subscriber or a Publisher) that will be fed to its child component  OpenViduVideoComponent . Its main task is not managing the final video player (that is  OpenViduVideoComponent  responsibility), but displaying custom information for each one of them (the user's nickname) and handling the click event on them to update property  mainStreamManager  of parent  AppComponent :  div className= streamcomponent  onClick={this.handleVideoClicked} \n     OpenViduVideoComponent streamManager={this.props.streamManager} / \n     div p {this.getNicknameTag()} /p /div  /div   export default class UserVideoComponent extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n\n        this.handleVideoClicked = this.handleVideoClicked.bind(this);\n    }\n\n    getNicknameTag() {\n        // Gets the nickName of the user\n        return JSON.parse(this.props.streamManager.stream.connection.data).clientData;\n    }\n\n    handleVideoClicked(event) {\n        // Triggers event for the parent component to update its main video display (other UserVideoComponent)\n        if (this.props.mainVideoStream) {\n            this.props.mainVideoStream(this.props.streamManager);\n        }\n    }\n}  OpenViduVideoComponent  html template is just the video element:  video autoPlay={true} ref={this.videoRef} /   And the unique responsibility of the component's logic is letting OpenVidu know the exact HTML DOM video player associated to its StreamManger. To do so we use method  StreamManager.addVideoElement , which receives a native HTML video element. The way we implement this is React Refs: we get the video element with  React.createRef()  and we call the method once after the component output has been rendered to the DOM (   componentDidMount   ).  export default class OpenViduVideoComponent extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n\n        this.videoRef = React.createRef();\n    }\n\n    componentDidMount() {\n        if (this.props   !!this.videoRef) {\n            this.props.streamManager.addVideoElement(this.videoRef.current);\n        }\n    }\n}",

Without going into too much detail, this method performs two  ajax  requests to OpenVidu Server, passing OpenVidu Server secret to authenticate them:   First ajax request performs a POST to  /api/sessions  (we send a  customSessionId  field to name the session with our  sessionName  value retrieved from HTML input)  Second ajax request performs a POST to  /api/tokens  (we send a  session  field to assign the token to this same session)   You can inspect this method in detail in the  GitHub repo .",

This means that it is a preview version of Ionic 4 and that could cause sporadic problems. The moment final stable version of Ionic 4 is released, this project will be updated to use it.\n    \n\n    \nBugs reported:\n\n    \n\n        \nAndroid 5 (Lollipop) and 6 (Marshmallow) will not work with Ionic v4-beta until \nthis issue\n is solved\n\n        \nThis app will not work in iOS because of \nproblems between WebRTC and iOS\n. We are currently working to overcome this problems\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding this tutorial\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu is composed by the three modules displayed on the image above in its insecure version.\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-browser\n: NPM package for your Angular app. It allows you to manage your video-calls straight away from your clients\n\n\nopenvidu-server\n: Java application that controls Kurento Media Server\n\n\nKurento Media Server\n: server that handles low level operations of media flow transmissions\n\n\n\n\nRunning this tutorial:\n\n\nUsing the browser\n\n\n1) Clone the repo:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/OpenVidu/openvidu-tutorials.git\n\n\n\n\n2) You will need \nNode\n, \nNPM\n and \nIonic\n to serve the app. Install them with the following command:\n\n\nsudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\nsudo npm install -g ionic@latest\n\n\n\n\n3) Run the tutorial:\n\n\ncd openvidu-tutorials/openvidu-ionic\nnpm install\nionic serve\n\n\n\n\n4) \nopenvidu-server\n and \nKurento Media Server\n must be up and running in your development machine. The easiest way is running this Docker container which wraps both of them (you will need \nDocker CE\n):\n\n\ndocker run -p 4443:4443 --rm -e openvidu.secret=MY_SECRET openvidu/openvidu-server-kms:2.6.0\n\n\n\n\n5) Go to \nlocalhost:8100\n to test the app once the server is running. The first time you use the docker container, an alert message will suggest you accept the self-signed certificate of \nopenvidu-server\n when you first try to join a video-call.\n\n\n6) To show the app with the device appearance, press \nF12\n button in your keyboard and the browser DevTools will be opened. You can find a button with a device icon at the top of the DevTools. By pressing this button the view will adapt to a mobile device aspect ratio. You can also choose predefined types of devices to see the behavior of your app in different resolutions.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using \nWindows\n, read this \nFAQ\n to properly run the tutorial\n\n\nTo learn \nsome tips\n to develop with OpenVidu, check this \nFAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Android APK in an Android device\n\n\nTo deploy the Android APK not only you need to have \nJava JDK8\n, \nAndroid Studio\n and \nAndroid SDK\n installed but also you have to set up the specific \nenvironment variables\n. Fortunately, Ionic provide us a \ngreat guide\n to allows us to configure step by step all the requirements.\n\n\nAfter we have completed all the steps the Ionic guide, we must continue with the followinf commands:\n\n\n1) Clone the repo:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/OpenVidu/openvidu-tutorials.git\n\n\n\n\n2) You will need \nNode\n, \nNPM\n and \nIonic\n to serve the app. Install them with the following command:\n\n\nsudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\nsudo npm install -g ionic@latest\n\n\n\n\n3) Connect the device to the same network as your PC.\n\n\n4) Now you need the IP of your PC in the network. In Linux/OSX you can simply get it by running this command on your shell:\n\n\nawk '/inet / \n $2 != \n127.0.0.1\n{print $2}' \n(ifconfig)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will probably output something like \n192.168.0.105\n. Your \ncomplete OpenVidu public url\n would then be \nhttps://192.168.0.105:4443/\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have your OpenVidu public url, you must set it in \nOPENVIDU_SERVER_URL\n variable \nin the app\n and in the \nopenvidu.publicurl\n parameter used to run \nopenvidu-server\n (see next point)\n\n\n5) \nopenvidu-server\n and \nKurento Media Server\n must be up and running in your development machine. The easiest way is running this Docker container which wraps both of them (you will need \nDocker CE\n)\n\n\ndocker run -p 4443:4443 --rm -e openvidu.secret=MY_SECRET -e openvidu.publicurl=YOUR_OPENVIDU_PUBLIC_URL openvidu/openvidu-server-kms:2.6.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember changing \nopenvidu.publicurl\n parameter to the actual value. In this example that would be:\n-e openvidu.publicurl=https://192.168.0.105:4443/\n\n\n\n\n6) Connect the device to the PC. You must enable USB debugging and give permissions (check out \nlast section here in Ionic docs\n)\n\n\n7) Run the tutorial. The app will be automatically launched in your Android device:\n\n\ncd openvidu-tutorials/openvidu-ionic\nnpm install\nionic cordova run android\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the code\n\n\nThis is an Ionic project generated with ionic-cli tool, and therefore you will see lots of configuration files and other stuff that doesn't really matter to us. We will focus on the following files under \nsrc/app/\n folder:\n\n\n\n\napp.component.ts\n: defines \nAppComponent\n, main component of the app. It contains the functionalities for joining a video-call and for handling the video-calls themselves.\n\n\napp.component.html\n: HTML for AppComponent.\n\n\napp.component.css\n: CSS for AppComponent.\n\n\nuser-video.component.ts\n: defines \nUserVideoComponent\n, used to display every user video. It contains one \nOpenViduVideoComponent\n, the name of the user and also handles a click event to update the view of \nAppComponent\n.\n\n\nov-video.component.ts\n: defines \nOpenViduVideoComponent\n, which wraps the final HTML \nvideo\n that finally displays the media stream.\n\n\n\n\nLet's see first how \napp.component.ts\n uses NPM package \nopenvidu-browser\n:\n\n\n\n\nWe import the necessary objects from \nopenvidu-browser\n:\n\n\nimport { OpenVidu, Publisher, Session, StreamEvent, StreamManager, Subscriber } from 'openvidu-browser';\n\n\n\n\n\n\napp.component.ts\n declares the following properties:\n\n\n// OpenVidu objects\nOV: OpenVidu;\nsession: Session;\npublisher: StreamManager; // Local\nsubscribers: StreamManager[] = []; // Remotes\n\n// Join form\nmySessionId: string;\nmyUserName: string;\n\n// Main video of the page, will be 'publisher' or one of the 'subscribers'\n// Updated by click event\nmainStreamManager: StreamManager;\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu\n object will allow us to get a \nSession\n object, which is declared just after it. \npublisher\n StreamManager object will be our own local webcam stream and \nsubscribers\n StreamManager array will store the active streams of other users in the video-call. Finally, \nmySessionId\n and \nmyUserName\n params simply represent the video-call and your participant's nickname, as you will see in a moment.\n\n\n\n\nWhenever a user clicks on the join button defined in \napp.component.html\n, \njoinSession()\n method is called:\n\n\n\n\nWe first get an OpenVidu object and initialize a Session object with it.\n\n\n// --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object ---\n\nthis.OV = new OpenVidu();\n\n// --- 2) Init a session ---\n\nthis.session = this.OV.initSession();\n\n\n\n\nThen we subscribe to the Session events that interest us.\n\n\n// --- 3) Specify the actions when events take place in the session ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nthis.session.on('streamCreated', (event: StreamEvent) =\n {\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it. Second parameter is undefined\n    // so OpenVidu doesn't create an HTML video on its own\n    const subscriber: Subscriber = this.session.subscribe(event.stream, undefined);\n    this.subscribers.push(subscriber);\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nthis.session.on('streamDestroyed', (event: StreamEvent) =\n {\n    // Remove the stream from 'subscribers' array\n    this.deleteSubscriber(event.stream.streamManager);\n});\n\n\n\n\nAs we are using Ionic and Angular framework, a good approach for managing the remote media streams is to loop across an array of them, feeding a common component with each \nSubscriber\n object and let it manage its video. This component will be our \nUserVideoComponent\n. To do this, we need to store each new Subscriber we received in array \nsubscribers\n (of its parent class \nStreamManager\n), and we must remove from it every deleted subscriber whenever it is necessary. To achieve this, we use the following events:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstreamCreated\n: for each new Stream received by the Session object, we subscribe to it and store the returned Subscriber object in our \nsubscribers\n array. Method \nsession.subscribe\n has \nundefined\n as second parameter so OpenVidu doesn't insert an HTML video element in the DOM on its own (we will use the video element contained in one of our child components). HTML template of \nAppComponent\n loops through \nsubscribers\n array with an \nngFor\n directive, declaring a \nUserVideoComponent\n for each subscriber. We feed them not really as \nSubscriber\n objects, but rather as their parent class \nStreamManager\n. This way we can reuse \nUserVideoComponent\n to also display our \nPublisher\n object (that also inhertis from class StreamManager). \nuser-video\n also declares an output event to let \nAppComponent\n know when the user has clicked on it.\n\n\nion-col size=\"6\" *ngFor=\"let sub of subscribers\"\n\n  \ndiv class=\"stream-container\"\n\n    \nuser-video [streamManager]=\"sub\" (click)=\"updateMainStreamManager(sub)\"\n/user-video\n\n  \n/div\n\n\n/ion-col\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstreamDestroyed\n: for each Stream that has been destroyed from the Session object (which means a user has left the video-call), we remove the associated Subscriber from \nsubscribers\n array, so Angular will automatically delete the required UserVideoComponent from HTML. Each Stream object has a property \nstreamManager\n that indicates which Subscriber or Publisher owns it (in the same way, each StreamManager object also has a reference to its Stream).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet a \ntoken\n from OpenVidu Server\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \nWARNING\n: This is why this tutorial is an insecure application. We need to ask OpenVidu Server for a user token in order to connect to our session. \nThis process should entirely take place in our server-side\n, not in our client-side. But due to the lack of an application backend in this tutorial, the Angular front itself will perform the POST operations to OpenVidu Server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// --- 4) Connect to the session with a valid user token ---\n\n// 'getToken' method is simulating what your server-side should do.\n// 'token' parameter should be retrieved and returned by your own backend\nthis.getToken().then((token) =\n {\n    // See next point to see how to connect to the session using 'token'\n});\n\n\n\n\nNow we need a token from OpenVidu Server. In a production environment we would perform this operations in our application backend, by making use of the \nAPI REST\n, \nOpenVidu Java Client\n or \nOpenVidu Node Client\n. Here we have implemented the POST requests to OpenVidu Server in a method \ngetToken()\n that returns a Promise with the token, using \n@angular/http\n library. Without going into too much detail, this method performs two POST requests to OpenVidu Server, passing OpenVidu Server secret to authenticate them:\n\n\n\n\nFirst request performs a POST to \n/api/sessions\n (we send a \ncustomSessionId\n field to name the session with our \nmySessionId\n value retrieved from HTML input)\n\n\nSecond request performs a POST to \n/api/tokens\n (we send a \nsession\n field to assign the token to this same session)\n\n\n\n\nYou can inspect this method in detail in the \nGitHub repo\n.\n\n\n\n\nConnect to the session:\n\n\n// --- 4) Connect to the session with a valid user token ---\n\n// 'getToken' method is simulating what your server-side should do.\n// 'token' parameter should be retrieved and returned by your own backend\nthis.getToken().then((token) =\n {\n    // First param is the token got from OpenVidu Server. Second param can be retrieved by every user on event\n    // 'streamCreated' (property Stream.connection.data), and will be appended to DOM as the user's nickname\n    this.session\n        .connect(token, { clientData: this.myUserName })\n            .then(() =\n {\n                // --- 5) Requesting and Checking Android Permissions\n                if (this.platform.is('cordova')) {\n                    this.checkAndroidPermissions()\n                        .then(() =\n this.initPublisher())\n                        .catch((err) =\n console.error(err));\n                } else {\n                    this.initPublisher();\n                }\n            })\n            .catch((error) =\n {\n                console.log('There was an error connecting to the session:', error.code, error.message);\n            });\n});\n\n\n\n\nIn \nsession.connect\n method first param is the recently retrieved user token. Second param is the value every user will receive in \nevent.stream.connection.data\n property on \nstreamCreated\n event (this value will be used by \nUserVideoComponent\n to append the user's nickname to the his video). So in this case it is an object with a property \"clientData\" with value \"myUserName\", which is binded from HTML input \nion-input [(ngModel)]=\"myUserName\"\n/ion-input\n (filled by the user).\n\n\nIf the method succeeds and is running under a cordova platform, we will call and receive a promise from \ncheckAndroidPermissions()\n method. This method requests and checks the Android permissions that our app currently has in the device. Once the promise has been resolved, the \ninitPublisher()\n method will be called. \n\n\nWe will talk about the Android permissions in the last section.\n\n\nFinally publish your webcam calling \ninitPublisher()\n method:\n\n\ninitPublisher() {\n    // Init a publisher passing undefined as targetElement (we don't want OpenVidu to insert a video\n    // element: we will manage it on our own) and with the desired properties\n    const publisher: Publisher = this.OV.initPublisher(undefined, {\n        audioSource: undefined, // The source of audio. If undefined default microphone\n        videoSource: undefined, // The source of video. If undefined default webcam\n        publishAudio: true, // Whether you want to start publishing with your audio unmuted or not\n        publishVideo: true, // Whether you want to start publishing with your video enabled or not\n        resolution: '640x480', // The resolution of your video\n        frameRate: 30, // The frame rate of your video\n        insertMode: 'APPEND', // How the video is inserted in the target element 'video-container'\n        mirror: true, // Whether to mirror your local video or not\n    });\n\n    // --- 6) Publish your stream ---\n\n    this.session.publish(publisher);\n\n    // Set the main video in the page to display our webcam and store our Publisher\n    this.mainStreamManager = publisher;\n    this.publisher = publisher;\n}\n\n\n\n\nAfter receiving the promise resolved from \ncheckAndroidPermissions()\n (or if we are not running the Ionic app in a mobile device) we proceed to publish our webcam to the session. To do so we get a \nPublisher\n object with the desired properties and publish it to the Session through \nSession.publish()\n method. The rest of users will receive our Stream object and will execute their \nstreamCreated\n event. Finally we make the main video player (which is just another \nUserVideoComponent\n) display the Publisher object by default. This is the HTML code that will display the main stream manager:\n\n\ndiv *ngIf=\nmainStreamManager\n id=\nmain-video\n\n    \nuser-video [streamManager]=\nmainStreamManager\n/user-video\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we store the Publisher object under \nthis.publisher\n variable, which is also of parent class \nStreamManager\n. This way our webcam will be appended along all remote subscribers, in exactly the same way they are shown (remember all of them are displayed by \nUserVideoComponent\n):\n\n\ndiv *ngIf=\npublisher\n class=\nstream-container\n\n    \nuser-video [streamManager]=\npublisher\n (click)=\nupdateMainStreamManager(publisher)\n/user-video\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nLast point worth considering is the implementation of \nUserVideoComponent\n and \nOpenViduVideoComponent\n. Each \nUserVideoComponent\n manages one StreamManager object (a Subscriber or a Publisher) that will be fed to its child component \nOpenViduVideoComponent\n . Its main task is not managing the final video player (that is \nOpenViduVideoComponent\n responsibility), but displaying custom information for each one of them (the user's nickname in this case):\n\n\ndiv\n\n    \nov-video [streamManager]=\nstreamManager\n/ov-video\n\n    \ndiv\np\n{% raw %}{{getNicknameTag()}}{% endraw %}\n/p\n/div\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nexport class UserVideoComponent {\n\n    @Input()\n    streamManager: StreamManager;\n\n    getNicknameTag() {\n        try {\n            return JSON.parse(this.streamManager.stream.connection.data).clientData;\n        } catch (err) {\n            console.error('ClientData is not JSON formatted');\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nOpenViduVideoComponent\n html template is just the video element:\n\n\nvideo #videoElement\n/video\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the unique responsibility of the component's logic is letting OpenVidu know the exact HTML DOM video player associated to its StreamManger. To do so we use method \nStreamManager.addVideoElement\n, which receives a native HTML video element. The way we implement this is Angular dependant: we get the video element with \n@ViewChild\n tag and we call the method once after the view has initialized (\nngAfterViewInit\n) and once every time the StreamManager input changes (\nset\n method with \n@Input\n tag)\n\n\nexport class OpenViduVideoComponent implements AfterViewInit {\n\n    @ViewChild('videoElement') elementRef: ElementRef;\n    _streamManager: StreamManager;\n\n    ngAfterViewInit() {\n        this._streamManager.addVideoElement(this.elementRef.nativeElement);\n    }\n\n    @Input()\n    set streamManager(streamManager: StreamManager) {\n        this._streamManager = streamManager;\n        if (!!this.elementRef) {\n            this._streamManager.addVideoElement(this.elementRef.nativeElement);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaving the session:\n\n\nWhenever we want a user to leave the session, we just need to call \nsession.disconnect\n method in \napp.component.ts\n:\n\n\nleaveSession() {\n    // --- 7) Leave the session by calling 'disconnect' method over the Session object ---\n\n    if (this.session) {\n        this.session.disconnect();\n    }\n\n    // Empty all properties...\n    this.subscribers = [];\n    delete this.publisher;\n    delete this.session;\n    delete this.OV;\n    this.generateParticipantInfo();\n}\n\n\n\n\nAndroid Permisions\n\n\nIn the previous section, we have seen how we can connect to the session and publish our webcam. Before publishing it, we have to take into account that our app will need permissions for accessing the microphone and camera.\n\n\nFollowing next steps, we have been able to properly set up the Android permissions your Ionic app will need to work along OpenVidu.\n\n\nThese configurations are already included in this \nopenvidu-ionic\n project, so if you start from here no further configurations are needed. Otherwise, if you want to \nstart a new project with Ionic and OpenVidu\n, you should follow these simple steps:\n\n\n1) Install \nandroid-permissions\n Cordova and Ionic Native Plugin:\n\n\nionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-android-permissions\nnpm install --save @ionic-native/android-permissions@5.0.0-beta.21\n\n\n\n\n2) Add this plugin to your app's module (\nexample\n):\n\n\nimport { AndroidPermissions } from '@ionic-native/android-permissions/ngx';\n@NgModule({\n    providers: [\n        // others providers\n        AndroidPermissions,\n    ],\n)}\n\n\n\n\n3) Add this plugin to your component and use it (\nexample\n):\n\n\nimport { AndroidPermissions } from '@ionic-native/android-permissions/ngx';\n\nexport class AppComponent  {\n    constructor(private androidPermissions: AndroidPermissions)\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe are finally ready to request permissions to our device. To do so, we need to use \nrequestPermissions()\n and \ncheckPermission()\n methods offered by the plugin. \n\n\nIt is important to call these methods under \nplatform.ready()\n, just because it will tell us whenever the platform is ready and the native functionality can be actually called.\nYou can inspect this method in detail in the \nGitHub repo\n.\n\n\nYou should also declare an array of permissions to use as parameter of \nrequestPermissions()\n: \n\n\nANDROID_PERMISSIONS = [\n    this.androidPermissions.PERMISSION.CAMERA,\n    this.androidPermissions.PERMISSION.RECORD_AUDIO,\n    this.androidPermissions.PERMISSION.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS,\n];\n\n\n\n\n4) Last but not least, in \nroot\n directory you can find file \nconfig.xml\n. These permissions must be included inside of \nplatform name=\"android\"\n (\nexample\n):\n\n\nconfig-file mode=\nmerge\n parent=\n/*\n target=\nAndroidManifest.xml\n\n    \nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.CAMERA\n /\n\n    \nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\n /\n\n    \nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS\n /\n\n\n/config-file\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, you must add \nxmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n to the end of the opening \nwidget\n node.\n\n\nwidget id=\nio.openvidu.sample\n version=\n2.5.0\n xmlns=\nhttp://www.w3.org/ns/widgets\n xmlns:cdv=\nhttp://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0\n xmlns:android=\nhttp://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\n\n    ...\n\n/widget\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce these changes are added to our code, the app will be ready to run on our mobile phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

This component will be our  UserVideoComponent . To do this, we need to store each new Subscriber we received in array  subscribers  (of its parent class  StreamManager ), and we must remove from it every deleted subscriber whenever it is necessary. To achieve this, we use the following events:    streamCreated : for each new Stream received by the Session object, we subscribe to it and store the returned Subscriber object in our  subscribers  array. Method  session.subscribe  has  undefined  as second parameter so OpenVidu doesn't insert an HTML video element in the DOM on its own (we will use the video element contained in one of our child components). HTML template of  AppComponent  loops through  subscribers  array with an  ngFor  directive, declaring a  UserVideoComponent  for each subscriber. We feed them not really as  Subscriber  objects, but rather as their parent class  StreamManager . This way we can reuse  UserVideoComponent  to also display our  Publisher  object (that also inhertis from class StreamManager).  user-video  also declares an output event to let  AppComponent  know when the user has clicked on it.  ion-col size=\"6\" *ngFor=\"let sub of subscribers\" \n   div class=\"stream-container\" \n     user-video [streamManager]=\"sub\" (click)=\"updateMainStreamManager(sub)\" /user-video \n   /div  /ion-col     streamDestroyed : for each Stream that has been destroyed from the Session object (which means a user has left the video-call), we remove the associated Subscriber from  subscribers  array, so Angular will automatically delete the required UserVideoComponent from HTML. Each Stream object has a property  streamManager  that indicates which Subscriber or Publisher owns it (in the same way, each StreamManager object also has a reference to its Stream).",

To do so we get a  Publisher  object with the desired properties and publish it to the Session through  Session.publish()  method. The rest of users will receive our Stream object and will execute their  streamCreated  event. Finally we make the main video player (which is just another  UserVideoComponent ) display the Publisher object by default. This is the HTML code that will display the main stream manager:  div *ngIf= mainStreamManager  id= main-video \n     user-video [streamManager]= mainStreamManager /user-video  /div   And we store the Publisher object under  this.publisher  variable, which is also of parent class  StreamManager . This way our webcam will be appended along all remote subscribers, in exactly the same way they are shown (remember all of them are displayed by  UserVideoComponent ):  div *ngIf= publisher  class= stream-container \n     user-video [streamManager]= publisher  (click)= updateMainStreamManager(publisher) /user-video  /div   Last point worth considering is the implementation of  UserVideoComponent  and  OpenViduVideoComponent . Each  UserVideoComponent  manages one StreamManager object (a Subscriber or a Publisher) that will be fed to its child component  OpenViduVideoComponent  . Its main task is not managing the final video player (that is  OpenViduVideoComponent  responsibility), but displaying custom information for each one of them (the user's nickname in this case):  div \n     ov-video [streamManager]= streamManager /ov-video \n     div p {% raw %}{{getNicknameTag()}}{% endraw %} /p /div  /div   export class UserVideoComponent {\n\n    @Input()\n    streamManager: StreamManager;\n\n    getNicknameTag() {\n        try {\n            return JSON.parse(this.streamManager.stream.connection.data).clientData;\n        } catch (err) {\n            console.error('ClientData is not JSON formatted');\n        }\n    }\n}  OpenViduVideoComponent  html template is just the video element:  video #videoElement /video   And the unique responsibility of the component's logic is letting OpenVidu know the exact HTML DOM video player associated to its StreamManger. To do so we use method  StreamManager.addVideoElement , which receives a native HTML video element. The way we implement this is Angular dependant: we get the video element with  @ViewChild  tag and we call the method once after the view has initialized ( ngAfterViewInit ) and once every time the StreamManager input changes ( set  method with  @Input  tag)  export class OpenViduVideoComponent implements AfterViewInit {\n\n    @ViewChild('videoElement') elementRef: ElementRef;\n    _streamManager: StreamManager;\n\n    ngAfterViewInit() {\n        this._streamManager.addVideoElement(this.elementRef.nativeElement);\n    }\n\n    @Input()\n    set streamManager(streamManager: StreamManager) {\n        this._streamManager = streamManager;\n        if (!!this.elementRef) {\n            this._streamManager.addVideoElement(this.elementRef.nativeElement);\n        }\n    }\n}",

It is important to call these methods under  platform.ready() , just because it will tell us whenever the platform is ready and the native functionality can be actually called.\nYou can inspect this method in detail in the  GitHub repo .  You should also declare an array of permissions to use as parameter of  requestPermissions() :   ANDROID_PERMISSIONS = [\n    this.androidPermissions.PERMISSION.CAMERA,\n    this.androidPermissions.PERMISSION.RECORD_AUDIO,\n    this.androidPermissions.PERMISSION.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS,\n];  4) Last but not least, in  root  directory you can find file  config.xml . These permissions must be included inside of  platform name=\"android\"  ( example ):  config-file mode= merge  parent= /*  target= AndroidManifest.xml \n     uses-permission android:name= android.permission.CAMERA  / \n     uses-permission android:name= android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO  / \n     uses-permission android:name= android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS  /  /config-file   Moreover, you must add  xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"  to the end of the opening  widget  node.  widget id= io.openvidu.sample  version= 2.5.0  xmlns= http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets  xmlns:cdv= http://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0  xmlns:android= http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android \n    ... /widget   Once these changes are added to our code, the app will be ready to run on our mobile phone.    \n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

You can install it with:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install maven\n\n\n\n\n3) Run the tutorial:\n\n\ncd openvidu-tutorials/openvidu-js-java\nmvn package exec:java\n\n\n\n\n4) \nopenvidu-server\n and \nKurento Media Server\n must be up and running in your development machine. The easiest way is running this Docker container which wraps both of them (you will need \nDocker CE\n):\n\n\ndocker run -p 4443:4443 --rm -e openvidu.secret=MY_SECRET openvidu/openvidu-server-kms:2.6.0\n\n\n\n\n5) Go to \nhttps://localhost:5000\n to test the app once the server is running. The first time you use the docker container, an alert message will suggest you accept the self-signed certificate of \nopenvidu-server\n when you first try to join a video-call.

OpenVidu assumes you can identify your users so you can tell which users can connect to which video-calls, and what role (and therefore what permissions) each one of them will have in the calls. You can do this as you prefer. Here our backend will manage the users and their sessions with the easy-to-use and non-intrusive \nHttpSession\n API. In these posts multiple options for user session management in Java are explained, inlcuding the one used in this tutorial: \njournaldev.com\n, \nstudytonight.com\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackend\n: SpringBoot app with the following classes (\nsrc/main/java\n path, \nio.openvidu.js.java\n package)\n\n\n\n\nApp.java\n : entrypoint for the app\n\n\nLoginController.java\n : rest controller for handling login and logout operations\n\n\nSessionController.java\n : rest controller for getting OpenVidu tokens. It also stores our active video-calls and the users connected to them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend\n: Plain JS/HTML/CSS files (\nsrc/main/resources/static\n)\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n : openvidu-browser library. You don't have to manipulate this file.\n\n\napp.js\n : sample application main JavaScritp file, which makes use of \nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n.\n\n\n\n\nindex.html\n : HTML code for the form to login, the form to connect to a video-call and for the video-call itself. It has two links to both JavaScript files:\n\n\nscript src=\"openvidu-browser-VERSION.js\"\n/script\n\n\nscript src=\"app.js\"\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstyle.css\n: some CSS classes to style \nindex.html\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's describe the code following this scenario: a user logs into the app and connects to the video-call \"TUTORIAL\", where he publishes his webcam. A second user will connect to the same video-call just after that and publish its own webcam. Both of them will leave the call after a while.\n\n\n\n\n1) User logs in\n\n\nWe have implemented a method for making HTTP POST requests to the backend, as we will need to make at least three of them: one for logging in, one for getting a token from openvidu-server and one for letting know our backend when any user leaves the video-call. The header of the method looks like this:\n\n\nfunction httpPostRequest(url, body, errorMsg, callback)\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nurl\n is the path of the POST operation, \nbody\n the object to send as data, \nerrorMsg\n the output error message if something goes wrong and \ncallback\n the function to execute in case of success. As mentioned above, we need to call this method three times for each user that LOGS IN \ud83e\udc52 CONNECTS TO A VIDEO-CALL \ud83e\udc52 LEAVES THE VIDEO-CALL.\n\n\nindex.html\n will first show a form to log in:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\napp.js\n sends a POST request to \"/api-login/login\" passing the username and the password retrieved from the HTML form whenever \"Log in\" button is clicked:\n\n\nfunction logIn() {\n    var user = $(\n#user\n).val(); // Username\n    var pass = $(\n#pass\n).val(); // Password\n\n    httpPostRequest(\n        'api-login/login',\n        {user: user, pass: pass},\n        'Login WRONG',\n        (response) =\n {\n            // HTML shows logged-in page ...\n        }\n    );\n}\n\n\n\n\nLoginController.java\n checks the params are correct and if so sets an \nHttpSession\n for the newly logged user (adding a \"loggedUser\" attribute with its username in the HttpSession object):\n\n\n@RequestMapping(value = \n/login\n, method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic ResponseEntity\nObject\n login(@RequestBody String userPass, HttpSession httpSession) \n    throws ParseException {\n\n    System.out.println(\nLogging in | {user, pass}=\n + userPass);\n    // Retrieve params from POST body\n    JSONObject userPassJson = (JSONObject) new JSONParser().parse(userPass);\n    String user = (String) userPassJson.get(\nuser\n);\n    String pass = (String) userPassJson.get(\npass\n);\n\n    if (login(user, pass)) { // Correct user-pass\n        // Validate session and return OK \n        // Value stored in HttpSession allows us to identify the user in future requests\n        httpSession.setAttribute(\nloggedUser\n, user);\n        return new ResponseEntity\n(HttpStatus.OK);\n    } else { // Wrong user-pass\n        // Invalidate session and return error\n        httpSession.invalidate();\n        return new ResponseEntity\n(\nUser/Pass incorrect\n, HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) User connects to \"TUTORIAL\" video-call\n\n\nHTML will display now the user has logged a different form, asking for the video-call to connect and the nickname the user wants to have in it. So our 'publisher1' user would write TUTORIAL in \"Session\" field and press \"Join!\" button:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\napp.js\n will execute \njoinSession()\n method, which starts like this:\n\n\nfunction joinSession() {\n    getToken((token) =\n { ...\n\n\n\n\nSo the first thing to do here is to retrieve an OpenVidu \ntoken\n from our backend. Only when we have it available in the browser we will continue with the \njoin\n operation. Let's see what \ngetToken()\n looks like:\n\n\nfunction getToken(callback) {\n    sessionName = $(\n#sessionName\n).val(); // Video-call chosen by the user\n\n    httpPostRequest(\n        'api-sessions/get-token',\n        {sessionName: sessionName},\n        'Request of TOKEN gone WRONG:',\n        (response) =\n {\n            token = response[0]; // Get token from response\n            console.warn('Request of TOKEN gone WELL (TOKEN:' + token + ')');\n            callback(token); // Continue the join operation\n        }\n    );\n}\n\n\n\n\nHere is the second time we must call our \nhttpPostRequest()\n method, sending the session we want to connect (\nsessionName\n parameter) and waiting to get a \ntoken\n as response. The interesting part here is in \nSessionController.java\n at \n/api-sessions/get-token\n. First of all there are some important attributes in this class we must mention:\n\n\n// OpenVidu object as entrypoint of the SDK\nprivate OpenVidu openVidu;\n\n// Collection to pair session names and OpenVidu Session objects\nprivate Map\nString, Session\n mapSessions = new ConcurrentHashMap\n();\n// Collection to pair session names and tokens (the inner Map pairs tokens and role associated)\nprivate Map\nString, Map\nString, OpenViduRole\n mapSessionNamesTokens = new ConcurrentHashMap\n();\n\n// URL where our OpenVidu server is listening\nprivate String OPENVIDU_URL;\n// Secret shared with our OpenVidu server\nprivate String SECRET;\n\n\n\n\nRest controller method begins retrieving the param send by the client, which in this case is the video-call name (\"TUTORIAL\"), as well as preparing a param we will need a little further on: \ntokenOptions\n.\n\n\n@RequestMapping(value = \n/get-token\n, method = RequestMethod.POST)\n    public ResponseEntity\nJSONObject\n getToken(@RequestBody String sessionNameParam,\n        HttpSession httpSession) throws ParseException {\n\n    // ... check the user is logged with HttpSession and continue ...\n\n    JSONObject sessionJSON = (JSONObject) new JSONParser().parse(sessionNameParam);\n\n    // The video-call to connect (\nTUTORIAL\n)\n    String sessionName = (String) sessionJSON.get(\nsessionName\n);\n\n    // Role associated to this user\n    OpenViduRole role = LoginController.users.get(httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n)).role;\n\n    // Optional data to be passed to other users when this user connects to the video-call\n    // In this case, a JSON with the value we stored in the HttpSession object on login\n    String serverData = \n{\\\nserverData\\\n: \\\n + httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n) + \n\\\n}\n;\n\n    // Build tokenOptions object with the serverData and the role\n    TokenOptions tokenOptions = new TokenOptions.Builder().data(serverData).role(role).build();\n\n    JSONObject responseJson = new JSONObject();\n\n\n\n\nJust after that an \nif-else\n statement comes into play: does the session \"TUTORIAL\" already exist?\n\n\nif (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null) { ...\n\n\n\n\nIn this case it doesn't because 'publisher1' is the first user connecting to it. So we focus on the \nelse\n branch:\n\n\nelse {\n    // New session\n    System.out.println(\nNew session \n + sessionName);\n    try {\n\n        // Create a new OpenVidu Session\n        Session session = this.openVidu.createSession();\n        // Generate a new token with the recently created tokenOptions\n        String token = session.generateToken(tokenOptions);\n\n        // Store the session and the token in our collections\n        this.mapSessions.put(sessionName, session);\n        this.mapSessionNamesTokens.put(sessionName, new ConcurrentHashMap\n());\n        this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName).put(token, role);\n\n        // Prepare the response with the token\n        responseJson.put(0, token);\n\n        // Return the response to the client\n        return new ResponseEntity\n(responseJson, HttpStatus.OK);\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // If error generate an error message and return it to client\n        return getErrorResponse(e);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe are almost there! Now in \napp.js\n we can init a new Session and connect to it with \ntoken\n:\n\n\n// --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object ---\n\nOV = new OpenVidu();\n\n// --- 2) Init a session ---\n\nsession = OV.initSession();\n\n// --- 3) Specify the actions when events take place in the session ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nsession.on('streamCreated', (event) =\n {\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it\n    // HTML video will be appended to element with 'video-container' id\n    var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'video-container');\n\n    // When the HTML video has been appended to DOM...\n    subscriber.on('videoElementCreated', (event) =\n {\n\n        // Add a new HTML element for the user's name and nickname over its video\n        appendUserData(event.element, subscriber.stream.connection);\n    });\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nsession.on('streamDestroyed', (event) =\n {\n    // Delete the HTML element with the user's name and nickname\n    removeUserData(event.stream.connection);\n});\n\n// --- 4) Connect to the session passing the retrieved token and some more data from\n//        the client (in this case a JSON with the nickname chosen by the user) ---\n\nvar nickName = $(\n#nickName\n).val();\nsession.connect(token, { clientData: nickName })\n    .then(() =\n {\n\n        // --- 5) Set page layout for active call ---\n\n        var userName = $(\n#user\n).val();\n        $('#session-title').text(sessionName);\n        $('#join').hide();\n        $('#session').show();\n\n\n        // Here we check somehow if the user has 'PUBLISHER' role before\n        // trying to publish its stream. Even if someone modified the client's code and\n        // published the stream, it wouldn't work if the token sent in Session.connect\n        // method is not recognized as 'PUBLIHSER' role by OpenVidu Server\n        if (isPublisher(userName)) {\n\n            // --- 6) Get your own camera stream ---\n\n            var publisher = OV.initPublisher('video-container', {\n                audioSource: undefined, // The source of audio. If undefined default microphone\n                videoSource: undefined, // The source of video. If undefined default webcam\n                publishAudio: true,     // Whether you want to start publishing with your audio unmuted or not\n                publishVideo: true,     // Whether you want to start publishing with your video enabled or not\n                resolution: '640x480',  // The resolution of your video\n                frameRate: 30,          // The frame rate of your video\n                insertMode: 'APPEND',   // How the video is inserted in the target element 'video-container'\n                mirror: false           // Whether to mirror your local video or not\n            });\n\n            // --- 7) Specify the actions when events take place in our publisher ---\n\n            // When our HTML video has been added to DOM...\n            publisher.on('videoElementCreated', (event) =\n {\n                // Init the main video with ours and append our data\n                var userData = {\n                    nickName: nickName,\n                    userName: userName\n                };\n                initMainVideo(event.element, userData);\n                appendUserData(event.element, userData);\n                $(event.element).prop('muted', true); // Mute local video\n            });\n\n\n            // --- 8) Publish your stream ---\n\n            session.publish(publisher);\n\n        } else {\n            console.warn('You don\\'t have permissions to publish');\n            initMainVideoThumbnail(); // Show SUBSCRIBER message in main video\n        }\n    })\n    .catch(error =\n {\n        console.warn('There was an error connecting to the session:', error.code, error.message);\n    });\n\n\n\n\nThe user will now see its own video on the page. The connection to the session has completed!\n\n\n\n\n3) Another user connects to the video-call\n\n\nThe process would be exactly the same as before until \nSessionController.java\n executes \ngetToken()\n method. Now session 'TUTORIAL' already exists, so in the \nif-else\n statement the \nif\n branch would be the one executed:\n\n\nif (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null) {\n    // Session already exists\n    System.out.println(\nExisting session \n + sessionName);\n    try {\n\n        // Generate a new token with the recently created tokenOptions\n        String token = this.mapSessions.get(sessionName).generateToken(tokenOptions);\n\n        // Update our collection storing the new token\n        this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName).put(token, role);\n\n        // Prepare the response with the token\n        responseJson.put(0, token);\n\n        // Return the response to the client\n        return new ResponseEntity\n(responseJson, HttpStatus.OK);\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // If error generate an error message and return it to client\n        return getErrorResponse(e);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe code executed in \napp.js\n would also be the same. After the \nSession.publish()\n method has been successful, both users will be seeing each other's video, as well as the username and nickname uppon it.\n\n\n\n\n4) Users leave the video-call\n\n\nAfter a while both users decide to leave the session. Apart from calling \nleaveSession()\n (and therefore \nsession.disconnect()\n) to destroy the connection on OpenVidu Server, we need to run the last POST operation: we must let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens. To sum up, \nsession.disconnect()\n updates our OpenVidu Server and the POST operation updates our application's backend.\nFor the POST operation, in \napp.js\n we run:\n\n\nfunction removeUser() {\n    httpPostRequest(\n        'api-sessions/remove-user',\n        {sessionName: sessionName, token: token},\n        'User couldn\\'t be removed from session',\n        (response) =\n {\n            console.warn(\nYou have been removed from session \n + sessionName);\n        }\n    );\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd in \nSessionController.java\n we update the collections:\n\n\n@RequestMapping(value = \n/remove-user\n, method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic ResponseEntity\nJSONObject\n removeUser(@RequestBody String sessionNameToken,\n    HttpSession httpSession) throws Exception {\n\n    // ... check the user is logged with HttpSession and continue ...\n\n    // Retrieve the params from BODY\n    JSONObject sessionNameTokenJSON = (JSONObject) new JSONParser().parse(sessionNameToken);\n    String sessionName = (String) sessionNameTokenJSON.get(\nsessionName\n);\n    String token = (String) sessionNameTokenJSON.get(\ntoken\n);\n\n    // If the session exists (\nTUTORIAL\n in this case)\n    if (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null \n this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName) != null) {\n\n        // If the token exists and is succesfully removed\n        if (this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName).remove(token) != null) {\n            // User left the session\n            if (this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName).isEmpty()) {\n                // Last user left: session must be removed\n                this.mapSessions.remove(sessionName);\n            }\n            return new ResponseEntity\n(HttpStatus.OK);\n        } else {\n            // The TOKEN wasn't valid\n            System.out.println(\nProblems in the app server: the TOKEN wasn't valid\n);\n            return new ResponseEntity\n(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\n        }\n    } else {\n        // The SESSION does not exist\n        System.out.println(\nProblems in the app server: the SESSION does not exist\n);\n        return new ResponseEntity\n(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen the last user leaves the session \nthis.mapSessions.remove(sessionName);\n will be executed: this means the session is empty and that it has been closed in OpenVidu Server. All our Session objects and tokens associated to them will be invalidated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point we have covered all the important code from the tutorial. With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches: \nyou can implement your frontend and your backend as you want\n.\n\n\nThe only actual requirements are getting a valid \ntoken\n from  \nopenvidu-server\n (by using \nopenvidu-java-client\n, \nopenvidu-node-client\n or the \nREST API\n) and use it in \nopenvidu-browser\n to connect your clients to the sessions with \nSession.connect(token)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

So our 'publisher1' user would write TUTORIAL in \"Session\" field and press \"Join!\" button:  \n     app.js  will execute  joinSession()  method, which starts like this:  function joinSession() {\n    getToken((token) =  { ...  So the first thing to do here is to retrieve an OpenVidu  token  from our backend. Only when we have it available in the browser we will continue with the  join  operation. Let's see what  getToken()  looks like:  function getToken(callback) {\n    sessionName = $( #sessionName ).val(); // Video-call chosen by the user\n\n    httpPostRequest(\n        'api-sessions/get-token',\n        {sessionName: sessionName},\n        'Request of TOKEN gone WRONG:',\n        (response) =  {\n            token = response[0]; // Get token from response\n            console.warn('Request of TOKEN gone WELL (TOKEN:' + token + ')');\n            callback(token); // Continue the join operation\n        }\n    );\n}  Here is the second time we must call our  httpPostRequest()  method, sending the session we want to connect ( sessionName  parameter) and waiting to get a  token  as response. The interesting part here is in  SessionController.java  at  /api-sessions/get-token . First of all there are some important attributes in this class we must mention:  // OpenVidu object as entrypoint of the SDK\nprivate OpenVidu openVidu;\n\n// Collection to pair session names and OpenVidu Session objects\nprivate Map String, Session  mapSessions = new ConcurrentHashMap ();\n// Collection to pair session names and tokens (the inner Map pairs tokens and role associated)\nprivate Map String, Map String, OpenViduRole  mapSessionNamesTokens = new ConcurrentHashMap ();\n\n// URL where our OpenVidu server is listening\nprivate String OPENVIDU_URL;\n// Secret shared with our OpenVidu server\nprivate String SECRET;  Rest controller method begins retrieving the param send by the client, which in this case is the video-call name (\"TUTORIAL\"), as well as preparing a param we will need a little further on:  tokenOptions .  @RequestMapping(value =  /get-token , method = RequestMethod.POST)\n    public ResponseEntity JSONObject  getToken(@RequestBody String sessionNameParam,\n        HttpSession httpSession) throws ParseException {\n\n    // ... check the user is logged with HttpSession and continue ...\n\n    JSONObject sessionJSON = (JSONObject) new JSONParser().parse(sessionNameParam);\n\n    // The video-call to connect ( TUTORIAL )\n    String sessionName = (String) sessionJSON.get( sessionName );\n\n    // Role associated to this user\n    OpenViduRole role = LoginController.users.get(httpSession.getAttribute( loggedUser )).role;\n\n    // Optional data to be passed to other users when this user connects to the video-call\n    // In this case, a JSON with the value we stored in the HttpSession object on login\n    String serverData =  {\\ serverData\\ : \\  + httpSession.getAttribute( loggedUser ) +  \\ } ;\n\n    // Build tokenOptions object with the serverData and the role\n    TokenOptions tokenOptions = new TokenOptions.Builder().data(serverData).role(role).build();\n\n    JSONObject responseJson = new JSONObject();  Just after that an  if-else  statement comes into play: does the session \"TUTORIAL\" already exist?  if (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null) { ...  In this case it doesn't because 'publisher1' is the first user connecting to it. So we focus on the  else  branch:  else {\n    // New session\n    System.out.println( New session   + sessionName);\n    try {\n\n        // Create a new OpenVidu Session\n        Session session = this.openVidu.createSession();\n        // Generate a new token with the recently created tokenOptions\n        String token = session.generateToken(tokenOptions);\n\n        // Store the session and the token in our collections\n        this.mapSessions.put(sessionName, session);\n        this.mapSessionNamesTokens.put(sessionName, new ConcurrentHashMap ());\n        this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName).put(token, role);\n\n        // Prepare the response with the token\n        responseJson.put(0, token);\n\n        // Return the response to the client\n        return new ResponseEntity (responseJson, HttpStatus.OK);\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // If error generate an error message and return it to client\n        return getErrorResponse(e);\n    }\n}  We are almost there! Now in  app.js  we can init a new Session and connect to it with  token :  // --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object ---\n\nOV = new OpenVidu();\n\n// --- 2) Init a session ---\n\nsession = OV.initSession();\n\n// --- 3) Specify the actions when events take place in the session ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nsession.on('streamCreated', (event) =  {\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it\n    // HTML video will be appended to element with 'video-container' id\n    var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'video-container');\n\n    // When the HTML video has been appended to DOM...\n    subscriber.on('videoElementCreated', (event) =  {\n\n        // Add a new HTML element for the user's name and nickname over its video\n        appendUserData(event.element, subscriber.stream.connection);\n    });\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nsession.on('streamDestroyed', (event) =  {\n    // Delete the HTML element with the user's name and nickname\n    removeUserData(event.stream.connection);\n});\n\n// --- 4) Connect to the session passing the retrieved token and some more data from\n//        the client (in this case a JSON with the nickname chosen by the user) ---\n\nvar nickName = $( #nickName ).val();\nsession.connect(token, { clientData: nickName })\n    .then(() =  {\n\n        // --- 5) Set page layout for active call ---\n\n        var userName = $( #user ).val();\n        $('#session-title').text(sessionName);\n        $('#join').hide();\n        $('#session').show();\n\n\n        // Here we check somehow if the user has 'PUBLISHER' role before\n        // trying to publish its stream.

Apart from calling  leaveSession()  (and therefore  session.disconnect() ) to destroy the connection on OpenVidu Server, we need to run the last POST operation: we must let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens. To sum up,  session.disconnect()  updates our OpenVidu Server and the POST operation updates our application's backend.\nFor the POST operation, in  app.js  we run:  function removeUser() {\n    httpPostRequest(\n        'api-sessions/remove-user',\n        {sessionName: sessionName, token: token},\n        'User couldn\\'t be removed from session',\n        (response) =  {\n            console.warn( You have been removed from session   + sessionName);\n        }\n    );\n}  And in  SessionController.java  we update the collections:  @RequestMapping(value =  /remove-user , method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic ResponseEntity JSONObject  removeUser(@RequestBody String sessionNameToken,\n    HttpSession httpSession) throws Exception {\n\n    // ... check the user is logged with HttpSession and continue ...\n\n    // Retrieve the params from BODY\n    JSONObject sessionNameTokenJSON = (JSONObject) new JSONParser().parse(sessionNameToken);\n    String sessionName = (String) sessionNameTokenJSON.get( sessionName );\n    String token = (String) sessionNameTokenJSON.get( token );\n\n    // If the session exists ( TUTORIAL  in this case)\n    if (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null   this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName) != null) {\n\n        // If the token exists and is succesfully removed\n        if (this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName).remove(token) != null) {\n            // User left the session\n            if (this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName).isEmpty()) {\n                // Last user left: session must be removed\n                this.mapSessions.remove(sessionName);\n            }\n            return new ResponseEntity (HttpStatus.OK);\n        } else {\n            // The TOKEN wasn't valid\n            System.out.println( Problems in the app server: the TOKEN wasn't valid );\n            return new ResponseEntity (HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\n        }\n    } else {\n        // The SESSION does not exist\n        System.out.println( Problems in the app server: the SESSION does not exist );\n        return new ResponseEntity (HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\n    }\n}  When the last user leaves the session  this.mapSessions.remove(sessionName);  will be executed: this means the session is empty and that it has been closed in OpenVidu Server.

Both of them will leave the call after a while.\n\n\n\n\n1) User logs in\n\n\nAt path \n/\n a login form will be displayed:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe form will execute a POST operation to path \n/dashboard\n whenever \"Log in\" button is clicked, passing the username and the password:\n\n\nform class=\nform-group jumbotron\n action=\n/dashboard\n method=\npost\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nUser\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\ntext\n name=\nuser\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nPass\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\npassword\n name=\npass\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np class=\ntext-center\n\n        \nbutton class=\nbtn btn-lg btn-info\n type=\nsubmit\nLog in\n/button\n\n    \n/p\n\n\n/form\n\n\n\n\n\nLoginController.java\n first checks if the user is already logged (maybe he has just refreshed \n/dashboard\n page), and if so it just redirects to the dashboard itself. If the user is actually logging in, the method checks that the params are correct and if so sets an \nHttpSession\n for the newly logged user (adding a \"loggedUser\" attribute with its username in the HttpSession object). Finally it returns \ndashboard.html\n template:\n\n\n@RequestMapping(value = \n/dashboard\n, method = { RequestMethod.GET, RequestMethod.POST })\npublic String login(@RequestParam(name = \nuser\n, required = false) String user,\n            @RequestParam(name = \npass\n, required = false) String pass,\n            Model model, HttpSession httpSession) {\n\n    // Check if the user is already logged in\n    String userName = (String) httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n);\n    if (userName != null) { \n        // User is already logged. Immediately return dashboard\n        model.addAttribute(\nusername\n, userName);\n        return \ndashboard\n;\n    }\n\n    // User wasn't logged and wants to\n    if (login(user, pass)) { // Correct user-pass\n\n        // Validate session and return OK \n        // Value stored in HttpSession allows us to identify the user in future requests\n        httpSession.setAttribute(\nloggedUser\n, user);\n        model.addAttribute(\nusername\n, user);\n\n        // Return dashboard.html template\n        return \ndashboard\n;\n\n    } else { // Wrong user-pass\n        // Invalidate session and redirect to index.html\n        httpSession.invalidate();\n        return \nredirect:/\n;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) User connects to \"TUTORIAL\" video-call\n\n\ndashboard.html\n template will display a form asking for the video-call to connect and the nickname the user wants to have in it. So our 'publisher1' user would write TUTORIAL in \"Session\" field:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe form will execute a POST operation to path \n/session\n whenever \"Join!\" button is clicked, passing the nickname and the session name:\n\n\nform class=\nform-group\n action=\n/session\n method=\npost\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nParticipant\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\ntext\n name=\ndata\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nSession\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\ntext\n name=\nsession-name\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np class=\ntext-center\n\n        \nbutton class=\nbtn btn-lg btn-success\n type=\nsubmit\nJoin!\n/button\n\n    \n/p\n\n\n/form\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \nSessionController.java\n receives a request at \n/session\n path is when things get interesting.\nFirst of all there are some important attributes in this class we must mention:\n\n\n// OpenVidu object as entrypoint of the SDK\nprivate OpenVidu openVidu;\n\n// Collection to pair session names and OpenVidu Session objects\nprivate Map\nString, Session\n mapSessions = new ConcurrentHashMap\n();\n// Collection to pair session names and tokens (the inner Map pairs tokens and role associated)\nprivate Map\nString, Map\nString, OpenViduRole\n mapSessionNamesTokens = new ConcurrentHashMap\n();\n\n// URL where our OpenVidu server is listening\nprivate String OPENVIDU_URL;\n// Secret shared with our OpenVidu server\nprivate String SECRET;\n\n\n\n\nRest controller method receives both params sent by the client (whatever nickname the user has chosen and \"TUTORIAL\" as the sessionName). First it prepares a param we will need a little further on: \ntokenOptions\n.\n\n\n@RequestMapping(value = \n/session\n, method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic String joinSession(@RequestParam(name = \ndata\n) String clientData,\n            @RequestParam(name = \nsession-name\n) String sessionName,\n            Model model, HttpSession httpSession) {\n\n    // ... check the user is logged with HttpSession and continue ...\n\n    // Role associated to this user\n    OpenViduRole role = LoginController.users.get(httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n)).role;\n\n    // Optional data to be passed to other users when this user connects to the video-call\n    // In this case, a JSON with the value we stored in the HttpSession object on login\n    String serverData = \n{\\\nserverData\\\n: \\\n + httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n) + \n\\\n}\n;\n\n    // Build tokenOptions object with the serverData and the role\n    TokenOptions tokenOptions = new TokenOptions.Builder().data(serverData).role(role).build();\n\n\n\n\nJust after that an \nif-else\n statement comes into play: does the session \"TUTORIAL\" already exist?\n\n\nif (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null) { ...\n\n\n\n\nIn this case it doesn't because 'publisher1' is the first user connecting to it. So we focus on the \nelse\n branch:\n\n\nelse {\n    // New session\n    System.out.println(\nNew session \n + sessionName);\n    try {\n\n        // Create a new OpenVidu Session\n        Session session = this.openVidu.createSession();\n        // Generate a new token with the recently created tokenOptions\n        String token = session.generateToken(tokenOptions);\n\n        // Store the session and the token in our collections\n        this.mapSessions.put(sessionName, session);\n        this.mapSessionNamesTokens.put(sessionName, new ConcurrentHashMap\n());\n        this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName).put(token, role);\n\n        // Add all the needed attributes to the template\n        model.addAttribute(\nsessionName\n, sessionName);\n        model.addAttribute(\ntoken\n, token);\n        model.addAttribute(\nnickName\n, clientData);\n        model.addAttribute(\nuserName\n, httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n));\n\n        // Return session.html template\n        return \nsession\n;\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // If error just return dashboard.html template\n        model.addAttribute(\nusername\n, httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n));\n        return \ndashboard\n;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe are almost there! Now in \nsession.html\n JavaScript code (preceded by a tag \nscript th:inline=\"javascript\"\n) we can init a new Session and connect to it with \ntoken\n:\n\n\n// Get all the attributes from the template in Thymeleaf style\nvar sessionName = [[${ sessionName }]];\nvar token = [[${ token }]];\nvar nickName = [[${ nickName }]];\nvar userName = [[${ userName }]];\n\n// --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object ---\n\nOV = new OpenVidu();\n\n// --- 2) Init a session ---\n\nsession = OV.initSession();\n\n// --- 3) Specify the actions when events take place in the session ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nsession.on('streamCreated', (event) =\n {\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it\n    // HTML video will be appended to element with 'video-container' id\n    var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'video-container');\n\n    // When the HTML video has been appended to DOM...\n    subscriber.on('videoElementCreated', (event) =\n {\n\n        // Add a new HTML element for the user's name and nickname over its video\n        appendUserData(event.element, subscriber.stream.connection);\n    });\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nsession.on('streamDestroyed', (event) =\n {\n    // Delete the HTML element with the user's name and nickname\n    removeUserData(event.stream.connection);\n});\n\n// --- 4) Connect to the session passing the retrieved token and some more data from\n//        the client (in this case a JSON with the nickname chosen by the user) ---\n\nsession.connect(token, { clientData: nickName })\n    .then(() =\n {\n\n        // --- 5) Set page layout for active call ---\n\n        $('#session-title').text(sessionName);\n        $('#join').hide();\n        $('#session').show();\n\n\n        // Here we check somehow if the user has 'PUBLISHER' role before\n        // trying to publish its stream. Even if someone modified the client's code and\n        // published the stream, it wouldn't work if the token sent in Session.connect\n        // method is not recognized as 'PUBLIHSER' role by OpenVidu Server\n        if (isPublisher()) {\n\n            // --- 6) Get your own camera stream ---\n\n            var publisher = OV.initPublisher('video-container', {\n                audioSource: undefined, // The source of audio.

The connection to the session has completed!\n\n\n\n\n3) Another user connects to the video-call\n\n\nThe process would be exactly the same as before until \nSessionController.java\n executes \njoinSession()\n method. Now session 'TUTORIAL' already exists, so in the \nif-else\n statement the \nif\n branch would be the one executed:\n\n\nif (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null) {\n    // Session already exists\n    System.out.println(\nExisting session \n + sessionName);\n    try {\n\n        // Generate a new token with the recently created tokenOptions\n        String token = this.mapSessions.get(sessionName).generateToken(tokenOptions);\n\n        // Update our collection storing the new token\n        this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName).put(token, role);\n\n        // Add all the needed attributes to the template\n        model.addAttribute(\nsessionName\n, sessionName);\n        model.addAttribute(\ntoken\n, token);\n        model.addAttribute(\nnickName\n, clientData);\n        model.addAttribute(\nuserName\n, httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n));\n\n        // Return session.html template\n        return \nsession\n;\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // If error just return dashboard.html template\n        model.addAttribute(\nusername\n, httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n));\n        return \ndashboard\n;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe code executed in \nsession.html\n \n script \n tag would also be the same. After the \nSession.publish()\n method has been successful, both users will be seeing each other's video, as well as the username and nickname uppon it.\n\n\n\n\n4) Users leave the video-call\n\n\nAfter a while both users decide to leave the session. Apart from calling \nsession.disconnect()\n (triggered in \nleaveSession()\n \nonclick\n method) to destroy the connection on OpenVidu Server, we need another POST operation to let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens.\n\n\nIn \nsession.html\n template the \"Leave session\" button actually performs a POST operation to path \n/leave-session\n with a hidden form. Notice that when the user clicks the submit button, a POST operation will be triggered but also the \nleaveSession()\n method. First updates our application's backend. Second updates our OpenVidu Server.\n\n\nform action=\n/leave-session\n method=\npost\n\n    \ninput type=\nhidden\n name=\nsession-name\n th:value=\n${sessionName}\n/input\n\n    \ninput type=\nhidden\n name=\ntoken\n th:value=\n${token}\n/input\n\n    \nbutton id=\nbuttonLeaveSession\n class=\nbtn btn-large btn-danger\n type=\nsubmit\n onclick=\nleaveSession()\n\n        Leave session\n/button\n\n\n/form\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \nSessionController.java\n we update the collections:\n\n\n@RequestMapping(value = \n/leave-session\n, method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic String removeUser(@RequestParam(name = \nsession-name\n) String sessionName,\n            @RequestParam(name = \ntoken\n) String token,\n            Model model, HttpSession httpSession) throws Exception {\n\n    // ... check the user is logged with HttpSession and continue ...\n\n    // If the session exists (\nTUTORIAL\n in this case)\n    if (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null \n this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName) != null) {\n\n        // If the token exists\n        if (this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName).remove(token) != null) {\n            // User left the session\n            if (this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName).isEmpty()) {\n                // Last user left: session must be removed\n                this.mapSessions.remove(sessionName);\n            }\n            return \nredirect:/dashboard\n;\n\n        } else {\n            // The TOKEN wasn't valid\n            System.out.println(\nProblems in the app server: the TOKEN wasn't valid\n);\n            return \nredirect:/dashboard\n;\n        }\n\n    } else {\n        // The SESSION does not exist\n        System.out.println(\nProblems in the app server: the SESSION does not exist\n);\n        return \nredirect:/dashboard\n;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen the last user leaves the session \nthis.mapSessions.remove(sessionName);\n will be executed: this means the session is empty and that it has been closed in OpenVidu Server. All our Session objects and tokens associated to them will be invalidated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point we have covered all the important code from the tutorial. With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches: \nyou can implement your frontend and your backend as you want\n.\n\n\nThe only actual requirements are getting a valid \ntoken\n from  \nopenvidu-server\n (by using \nopenvidu-java-client\n, \nopenvidu-node-client\n or the \nREST API\n) and use it in \nopenvidu-browser\n to connect your clients to the sessions with \nSession.connect(token)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

So our 'publisher1' user would write TUTORIAL in \"Session\" field:  \n     The form will execute a POST operation to path  /session  whenever \"Join!\" button is clicked, passing the nickname and the session name:  form class= form-group  action= /session  method= post \n     p \n         label Participant /label \n         input class= form-control  type= text  name= data  required= true /input \n     /p \n     p \n         label Session /label \n         input class= form-control  type= text  name= session-name  required= true /input \n     /p \n     p class= text-center \n         button class= btn btn-lg btn-success  type= submit Join! /button \n     /p  /form   When  SessionController.java  receives a request at  /session  path is when things get interesting.\nFirst of all there are some important attributes in this class we must mention:  // OpenVidu object as entrypoint of the SDK\nprivate OpenVidu openVidu;\n\n// Collection to pair session names and OpenVidu Session objects\nprivate Map String, Session  mapSessions = new ConcurrentHashMap ();\n// Collection to pair session names and tokens (the inner Map pairs tokens and role associated)\nprivate Map String, Map String, OpenViduRole  mapSessionNamesTokens = new ConcurrentHashMap ();\n\n// URL where our OpenVidu server is listening\nprivate String OPENVIDU_URL;\n// Secret shared with our OpenVidu server\nprivate String SECRET;  Rest controller method receives both params sent by the client (whatever nickname the user has chosen and \"TUTORIAL\" as the sessionName). First it prepares a param we will need a little further on:  tokenOptions .  @RequestMapping(value =  /session , method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic String joinSession(@RequestParam(name =  data ) String clientData,\n            @RequestParam(name =  session-name ) String sessionName,\n            Model model, HttpSession httpSession) {\n\n    // ... check the user is logged with HttpSession and continue ...\n\n    // Role associated to this user\n    OpenViduRole role = LoginController.users.get(httpSession.getAttribute( loggedUser )).role;\n\n    // Optional data to be passed to other users when this user connects to the video-call\n    // In this case, a JSON with the value we stored in the HttpSession object on login\n    String serverData =  {\\ serverData\\ : \\  + httpSession.getAttribute( loggedUser ) +  \\ } ;\n\n    // Build tokenOptions object with the serverData and the role\n    TokenOptions tokenOptions = new TokenOptions.Builder().data(serverData).role(role).build();  Just after that an  if-else  statement comes into play: does the session \"TUTORIAL\" already exist?  if (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null) { ...  In this case it doesn't because 'publisher1' is the first user connecting to it. So we focus on the  else  branch:  else {\n    // New session\n    System.out.println( New session   + sessionName);\n    try {\n\n        // Create a new OpenVidu Session\n        Session session = this.openVidu.createSession();\n        // Generate a new token with the recently created tokenOptions\n        String token = session.generateToken(tokenOptions);\n\n        // Store the session and the token in our collections\n        this.mapSessions.put(sessionName, session);\n        this.mapSessionNamesTokens.put(sessionName, new ConcurrentHashMap ());\n        this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName).put(token, role);\n\n        // Add all the needed attributes to the template\n        model.addAttribute( sessionName , sessionName);\n        model.addAttribute( token , token);\n        model.addAttribute( nickName , clientData);\n        model.addAttribute( userName , httpSession.getAttribute( loggedUser ));\n\n        // Return session.html template\n        return  session ;\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // If error just return dashboard.html template\n        model.addAttribute( username , httpSession.getAttribute( loggedUser ));\n        return  dashboard ;\n    }\n}  We are almost there!

            "text": "After a while both users decide to leave the session. Apart from calling  session.disconnect()  (triggered in  leaveSession()   onclick  method) to destroy the connection on OpenVidu Server, we need another POST operation to let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens.  In  session.html  template the \"Leave session\" button actually performs a POST operation to path  /leave-session  with a hidden form. Notice that when the user clicks the submit button, a POST operation will be triggered but also the  leaveSession()  method. First updates our application's backend. Second updates our OpenVidu Server.  form action= /leave-session  method= post \n     input type= hidden  name= session-name  th:value= ${sessionName} /input \n     input type= hidden  name= token  th:value= ${token} /input \n     button id= buttonLeaveSession  class= btn btn-large btn-danger  type= submit  onclick= leaveSession() \n        Leave session /button  /form   In  SessionController.java  we update the collections:  @RequestMapping(value =  /leave-session , method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic String removeUser(@RequestParam(name =  session-name ) String sessionName,\n            @RequestParam(name =  token ) String token,\n            Model model, HttpSession httpSession) throws Exception {\n\n    // ... check the user is logged with HttpSession and continue ...\n\n    // If the session exists ( TUTORIAL  in this case)\n    if (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null   this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName) != null) {\n\n        // If the token exists\n        if (this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName).remove(token) != null) {\n            // User left the session\n            if (this.mapSessionNamesTokens.get(sessionName).isEmpty()) {\n                // Last user left: session must be removed\n                this.mapSessions.remove(sessionName);\n            }\n            return  redirect:/dashboard ;\n\n        } else {\n            // The TOKEN wasn't valid\n            System.out.println( Problems in the app server: the TOKEN wasn't valid );\n            return  redirect:/dashboard ;\n        }\n\n    } else {\n        // The SESSION does not exist\n        System.out.println( Problems in the app server: the SESSION does not exist );\n        return  redirect:/dashboard ;\n    }\n}  When the last user leaves the session  this.mapSessions.remove(sessionName);  will be executed: this means the session is empty and that it has been closed in OpenVidu Server. All our Session objects and tokens associated to them will be invalidated.    At this point we have covered all the important code from the tutorial. With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches:  you can implement your frontend and your backend as you want .  The only actual requirements are getting a valid  token  from   openvidu-server  (by using  openvidu-java-client ,  openvidu-node-client  or the  REST API ) and use it in  openvidu-browser  to connect your clients to the sessions with  Session.connect(token)     \n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

It makes use of \nopenvidu-node-client\n to connect to OpenVidu Server. With regard to the use of OpenVidu, it is identical to \nopenvidu-mvc-node\n. This tutorial is intended for developers who feel more comfortable with a SPA (Single Page Application) architecture for their frontends.\n\n\nUnderstanding this tutorial\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu is composed by the modules displayed on the image above.\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-browser\n: JavaScript library for the browser. It allows you to manage your video-calls straight away from your clients\n\n\nopenvidu-node-client\n: server SDK for Node. Quick alternative to REST API\n\n\nopenvidu-server\n: application to control Kurento Media Server\n\n\nKurento Media Server\n: handles low level operations of media flow transmissions\n\n\n\n\nRunning this tutorial\n\n\n1) Clone the repo:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/OpenVidu/openvidu-tutorials.git\n\n\n\n\n2) You will need \nnode\n to execute the app. You can install them with:\n\n\nsudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\n\n\n3) Run the tutorial with the following commands. They will install the NPM dependencies and will execute \nserver.js\n server passing two arguments: \"localhost:4443\" as the URL where \nopenvidu-server\n will be listening and \"MY_SECRET\" as the secret share with it:\n\n\ncd openvidu-tutorials/openvidu-js-node\nnpm install\nnode server.js localhost:4443 MY_SECRET\n\n\n\n\n4) \nopenvidu-server\n and \nKurento Media Server\n must be up and running in your development machine. The easiest way is running this Docker container which wraps both of them (you will need \nDocker CE\n):\n\n\ndocker run -p 4443:4443 --rm -e openvidu.secret=MY_SECRET openvidu/openvidu-server-kms:2.6.0\n\n\n\n\n5) Go to \nhttps://localhost:5000\n to test the app once the server is running. The first time you use the docker container, an alert message will suggest you accept the self-signed certificate of \nopenvidu-server\n when you first try to join a video-call. To test two users in the same computer, use a standard window and an incognito window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using \nWindows\n, read this \nFAQ\n to properly run the tutorial\n\n\nTo learn \nsome tips\n to develop with OpenVidu, check this \nFAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the code\n\n\nThis is a very basic web application with a pretty simple JS/HTML/CSS frontend and a straightforward Node backend built with \nexpress\n. OpenVidu assumes you can identify your users so you can tell which users can connect to which video-calls, and what role (and therefore what permissions) each one of them will have in the calls. You can do this as you prefer. Here our backend will manage the users and their sessions with the easy-to-use and non-intrusive \nexpress-session\n API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackend\n: node server\n\n\n\n\nserver.js\n : single file which handles all operations of server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend\n: Plain JS/HTML/CSS files (\n/public\n folder)\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n : openvidu-browser library. You don't have to manipulate this file.\n\n\napp.js\n : sample application main JavaScritp file, which makes use of \nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n.\n\n\n\n\nindex.html\n : HTML code for the form to login, the form to connect to a video-call and for the video-call itself. It has two links to both JavaScript files:\n\n\nscript src=\"openvidu-browser-VERSION.js\"\n/script\n\n\nscript src=\"app.js\"\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstyle.css\n: some CSS classes to style \nindex.html\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's describe the code following this scenario: a user logs into the app and connects to the video-call \"TUTORIAL\", where he publishes his webcam. A second user will connect to the same video-call just after that and publish its own webcam. Both of them will leave the call after a while.\n\n\n\n\n1) User logs in\n\n\nWe have implemented a method for making HTTP POST requests to the backend, as we will need to make at least three of them: one for logging in, one for getting a token from openvidu-server and one for letting know our backend when any user leaves the video-call. The header of the method looks like this:\n\n\nfunction httpPostRequest(url, body, errorMsg, callback)\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nurl\n is the path of the POST operation, \nbody\n the object to send as data, \nerrorMsg\n the output error message if something goes wrong and \ncallback\n the function to execute in case of success. As mentioned above, we need to call this method three times for each user that LOGS IN \ud83e\udc52 CONNECTS TO A VIDEO-CALL \ud83e\udc52 LEAVES THE VIDEO-CALL.\n\n\nindex.html\n will first show a form to log in:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\napp.js\n sends a POST request to \"/api-login/login\" passing the username and the password retrieved from the HTML form whenever \"Log in\" button is clicked:\n\n\nfunction logIn() {\n    var user = $(\n#user\n).val(); // Username\n    var pass = $(\n#pass\n).val(); // Password\n\n    httpPostRequest(\n        'api-login/login',\n        {user: user, pass: pass},\n        'Login WRONG',\n        (response) =\n {\n            // HTML shows logged-in page ...\n        }\n    );\n}\n\n\n\n\nserver.js\n at \n/api-login/login\n checks the params are correct and if so sets an active session for the newly logged user (adding a \nloggedUser\n property with its username in the \nreq.session\n object):\n\n\napp.post('/api-login/login', function (req, res) {\n\n    // Retrieve params from POST body\n    var user = req.body.user;\n    var pass = req.body.pass;\n\n    if (login(user, pass)) { // Correct user-pass\n        // Validate session and return OK\n        // Value stored in req.session allows us to identify the user in future requests\n        req.session.loggedUser = user;\n        res.status(200).send();\n    } else { // Wrong user-pass\n        // Invalidate session and return error\n        req.session.destroy();\n        res.status(401).send('User/Pass incorrect');\n    }\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) User connects to \"TUTORIAL\" video-call\n\n\nHTML will display now the user has logged a different form, asking for the video-call to connect and the nickname the user wants to have in it. So our 'publisher1' user would write TUTORIAL in \"Session\" field and press \"Join!\" button:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\napp.js\n will execute \njoinSession()\n method, which starts like this:\n\n\nfunction joinSession() {\n    getToken((token) =\n { ...\n\n\n\n\nSo the first thing to do here is to retrieve an OpenVidu \ntoken\n from our backend. Only when we have it available in the browser we will continue with the \njoin\n operation. Let's see what \ngetToken()\n looks like:\n\n\nfunction getToken(callback) {\n    sessionName = $(\n#sessionName\n).val(); // Video-call chosen by the user\n\n    httpPostRequest(\n        'api-sessions/get-token',\n        {sessionName: sessionName},\n        'Request of TOKEN gone WRONG:',\n        (response) =\n {\n            token = response[0]; // Get token from response\n            console.warn('Request of TOKEN gone WELL (TOKEN:' + token + ')');\n            callback(token); // Continue the join operation\n        }\n    );\n}\n\n\n\n\nHere is the second time we must call our \nhttpPostRequest()\n method, sending the session we want to connect (\nsessionName\n parameter) and waiting to get a \ntoken\n as response. The interesting part here is in \nserver.js\n controller at \n/api-sessions/get-token\n. First of all there are some important attributes in this class we must mention:\n\n\n// Environment variable: URL where our OpenVidu server is listening\nvar OPENVIDU_URL = process.argv[2];\n// Environment variable: secret shared with our OpenVidu server\nvar OPENVIDU_SECRET = process.argv[3];\n\n// Entrypoint to OpenVidu Node Client SDK\nvar OV = new OpenVidu(OPENVIDU_URL, OPENVIDU_SECRET);\n\n// Collection to pair session names with OpenVidu Session objects\nvar mapSessions = {};\n// Collection to pair session names with tokens\nvar mapSessionNamesTokens = {};\n\n\n\n\nRest controller method begins retrieving the param send by the client, which in this case is the video-call name (\"TUTORIAL\"), as well as preparing a param we will need a little further on: \ntokenOptions\n.\n\n\napp.post('/api-sessions/get-token', function (req, res) {\n\n   // ... check the user is logged with req.session and continue ...\n\n    // The video-call to connect (\nTUTORIAL\n)\n    var sessionName = req.body.sessionName;\n\n    // Role associated to this user\n    var role = users.find(u =\n (u.user === req.session.loggedUser)).role;\n\n    // Optional data to be passed to other users when this user connects to the video-call\n    // In this case, a JSON with the value we stored in the req.session object on login\n    var serverData = JSON.stringify({serverData: req.session.loggedUser});\n\n    // Build tokenOptions object with the serverData and the role\n    var tokenOptions = {\n        data: serverData,\n        role: role\n    };\n\n\n\n\nJust after that an \nif-else\n statement comes into play: does the session \"TUTORIAL\" already exist?\n\n\nif (mapSessions[sessionName]) { ...\n\n\n\n\nIn this case it doesn't because 'publisher1' is the first user connecting to it. So we focus on the \nelse\n branch:\n\n\nelse {\n    // New session\n    console.log('New session ' + sessionName);\n\n    // Create a new OpenVidu Session asynchronously\n    OV.createSession()\n        .then(session =\n {\n            // Store the new Session in the collection of Sessions\n            mapSessions[sessionName] = session;\n            // Store a new empty array in the collection of tokens\n            mapSessionNamesTokens[sessionName] = [];\n\n            // Generate a new token asynchronously with the recently created tokenOptions\n            session.generateToken(tokenOptions)\n                .then(token =\n {\n\n                    // Store the new token in the collection of tokens\n                    mapSessionNamesTokens[sessionName].push(token);\n\n                    // Return the Token to the client\n                    res.status(200).send({\n                        0: token\n                    });\n                })\n                .catch(error =\n {\n                    console.error(error);\n                });\n        })\n        .catch(error =\n {\n            console.error(error);\n        });\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe are almost there! Now in \napp.js\n we can init a new Session and connect to it with \ntoken\n:\n\n\n// --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object ---\n\nOV = new OpenVidu();\n\n// --- 2) Init a session ---\n\nsession = OV.initSession();\n\n// --- 3) Specify the actions when events take place in the session ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nsession.on('streamCreated', (event) =\n {\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it\n    // HTML video will be appended to element with 'video-container' id\n    var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'video-container');\n\n    // When the HTML video has been appended to DOM...\n    subscriber.on('videoElementCreated', (event) =\n {\n\n        // Add a new HTML element for the user's name and nickname over its video\n        appendUserData(event.element, subscriber.stream.connection);\n    });\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nsession.on('streamDestroyed', (event) =\n {\n    // Delete the HTML element with the user's name and nickname\n    removeUserData(event.stream.connection);\n});\n\n// --- 4) Connect to the session passing the retrieved token and some more data from\n//        the client (in this case a JSON with the nickname chosen by the user) ---\n\nvar nickName = $(\n#nickName\n).val();\nsession.connect(token, { clientData: nickName })\n    .then(() =\n {\n\n        // --- 5) Set page layout for active call ---\n\n        var userName = $(\n#user\n).val();\n        $('#session-title').text(sessionName);\n        $('#join').hide();\n        $('#session').show();\n\n\n        // Here we check somehow if the user has 'PUBLISHER' role before\n        // trying to publish its stream. Even if someone modified the client's code and\n        // published the stream, it wouldn't work if the token sent in Session.connect\n        // method is not recognized as 'PUBLIHSER' role by OpenVidu Server\n        if (isPublisher(userName)) {\n\n            // --- 6) Get your own camera stream ---\n\n            var publisher = OV.initPublisher('video-container', {\n                audioSource: undefined, // The source of audio. If undefined default microphone\n                videoSource: undefined, // The source of video. If undefined default webcam\n                publishAudio: true,     // Whether you want to start publishing with your audio unmuted or not\n                publishVideo: true,     // Whether you want to start publishing with your video enabled or not\n                resolution: '640x480',  // The resolution of your video\n                frameRate: 30,          // The frame rate of your video\n                insertMode: 'APPEND',   // How the video is inserted in the target element 'video-container'\n                mirror: false           // Whether to mirror your local video or not\n            });\n\n            // --- 7) Specify the actions when events take place in our publisher ---\n\n            // When our HTML video has been added to DOM...\n            publisher.on('videoElementCreated', (event) =\n {\n                // Init the main video with ours and append our data\n                var userData = {\n                    nickName: nickName,\n                    userName: userName\n                };\n                initMainVideo(event.element, userData);\n                appendUserData(event.element, userData);\n                $(event.element).prop('muted', true); // Mute local video\n            });\n\n\n            // --- 8) Publish your stream ---\n\n            session.publish(publisher);\n\n        } else {\n            console.warn('You don\\'t have permissions to publish');\n            initMainVideoThumbnail(); // Show SUBSCRIBER message in main video\n        }\n    })\n    .catch(error =\n {\n        console.warn('There was an error connecting to the session:', error.code, error.message);\n    });\n\n\n\n\nThe user will now see its own video on the page. The connection to the session has completed!\n\n\n\n\n3) Another user connects to the video-call\n\n\nThe process would be exactly the same as before until \nserver.js\n executes controller at \n/api-sessions/get-token\n. Now session 'TUTORIAL' already exists, so in the \nif-else\n statement the \nif\n branch would be the one executed:\n\n\nif (mapSessions[sessionName]) {\n    // Session already exists\n    console.log('Existing session ' + sessionName);\n\n    // Get the existing Session from the collection\n    var mySession = mapSessions[sessionName];\n\n    // Generate a new token asynchronously with the recently created tokenOptions\n    mySession.generateToken(tokenOptions)\n        .then(token =\n {\n\n            // Store the new token in the collection of tokens\n            mapSessionNamesTokens[sessionName].push(token);\n\n            // Return the token to the client\n            res.status(200).send({\n                0: token\n            });\n        })\n        .catch(error =\n {\n            console.error(error);\n        });\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe code executed in \napp.js\n would also be the same. After the \nSession.publish()\n method has been successful, both users will be seeing each other's video, as well as the username and nickname uppon it.\n\n\n\n\n4) Users leave the video-call\n\n\nAfter a while both users decide to leave the session. Apart from calling \nleaveSession()\n (and therefore \nsession.disconnect()\n) to destroy the connection on OpenVidu Server, we need to run the last POST operation: we must let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens. To sum up, \nsession.disconnect()\n updates our OpenVidu Server and the POST operation updates our application's backend.\nFor the POST operation, in \napp.js\n we run:\n\n\nfunction removeUser() {\n    httpPostRequest(\n        'api-sessions/remove-user',\n        {sessionName: sessionName, token: token},\n        'User couldn\\'t be removed from session', \n        (response) =\n {\n            console.warn(\nYou have been removed from session \n + sessionName);\n        }\n    );\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd in \nserver.js\n we update the collections in \n/api-sessions/remove-user\n:\n\n\n\napp.post('/api-sessions/remove-user', function (req, res) {\n\n    // ... check the user is logged with req.session and continue ...\n\n    // Retrieve params from POST body\n    var sessionName = req.body.sessionName;\n    var token = req.body.token;\n\n    // If the session exists\n    if (mapSessions[sessionName] \n mapSessionNamesTokens[sessionName]) {\n        var tokens = mapSessionNamesTokens[sessionName];\n        var index = tokens.indexOf(token);\n\n        // If the token exists\n        if (index !== -1) {\n            // Token removed\n            tokens.splice(index, 1);\n        } else {\n            res.status(500).send('Problems in the app server: the TOKEN wasn\\'t valid');\n        }\n        if (tokens.length == 0) {\n            // Last user left: session must be removed\n            delete mapSessions[sessionName];\n        }\n        res.status(200).send();\n    } else {\n        res.status(500).send('Problems in the app server: the SESSION does not exist');\n    }\n});\n\n\n\n\nWhen the last user leaves the session \ndelete mapSessions[sessionName]\n will be executed: this means the session is empty and that it has been closed in OpenVidu Server. All our Session objects and tokens associated to them will be invalidated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point we have covered all the important code from the tutorial. With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches: \nyou can implement your frontend and your backend as you want\n.\n\n\nThe only actual requirements are getting a valid \ntoken\n from  \nopenvidu-server\n (by using \nopenvidu-java-client\n, \nopenvidu-node-client\n or the \nREST API\n) and use it in \nopenvidu-browser\n to connect your clients to the sessions with \nSession.connect(token)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

            "text": "After a while both users decide to leave the session. Apart from calling  leaveSession()  (and therefore  session.disconnect() ) to destroy the connection on OpenVidu Server, we need to run the last POST operation: we must let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens. To sum up,  session.disconnect()  updates our OpenVidu Server and the POST operation updates our application's backend.\nFor the POST operation, in  app.js  we run:  function removeUser() {\n    httpPostRequest(\n        'api-sessions/remove-user',\n        {sessionName: sessionName, token: token},\n        'User couldn\\'t be removed from session', \n        (response) =  {\n            console.warn( You have been removed from session   + sessionName);\n        }\n    );\n}  And in  server.js  we update the collections in  /api-sessions/remove-user :  \napp.post('/api-sessions/remove-user', function (req, res) {\n\n    // ... check the user is logged with req.session and continue ...\n\n    // Retrieve params from POST body\n    var sessionName = req.body.sessionName;\n    var token = req.body.token;\n\n    // If the session exists\n    if (mapSessions[sessionName]   mapSessionNamesTokens[sessionName]) {\n        var tokens = mapSessionNamesTokens[sessionName];\n        var index = tokens.indexOf(token);\n\n        // If the token exists\n        if (index !== -1) {\n            // Token removed\n            tokens.splice(index, 1);\n        } else {\n            res.status(500).send('Problems in the app server: the TOKEN wasn\\'t valid');\n        }\n        if (tokens.length == 0) {\n            // Last user left: session must be removed\n            delete mapSessions[sessionName];\n        }\n        res.status(200).send();\n    } else {\n        res.status(500).send('Problems in the app server: the SESSION does not exist');\n    }\n});  When the last user leaves the session  delete mapSessions[sessionName]  will be executed: this means the session is empty and that it has been closed in OpenVidu Server. All our Session objects and tokens associated to them will be invalidated.    At this point we have covered all the important code from the tutorial. With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches:  you can implement your frontend and your backend as you want .  The only actual requirements are getting a valid  token  from   openvidu-server  (by using  openvidu-java-client ,  openvidu-node-client  or the  REST API ) and use it in  openvidu-browser  to connect your clients to the sessions with  Session.connect(token)     \n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

            "text": "openvidu-mvc-node\n\n\n Check it on GitHub\n\n\nA secure OpenVidu sample app with a Node backend and a traditional MVC frontend. It makes use of \nopenvidu-node-client\n to connect to OpenVidu Server. With regard to the use of OpenVidu, it is identical to \nopenvidu-js-node\n. This tutorial is intended for developers who feel more comfortable with MVC web architectures for their frontends. \nEmbedded JavaScript\n is the template engine of choice for this tutorial.\n\n\nUnderstanding this tutorial\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu is composed by the modules displayed on the image above.\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-browser\n: JavaScript library for the browser. It allows you to manage your video-calls straight away from your clients\n\n\nopenvidu-node-client\n: server SDK for Node. Quick alternative to REST API\n\n\nopenvidu-server\n: application to control Kurento Media Server\n\n\nKurento Media Server\n: handles low level operations of media flow transmissions\n\n\n\n\nRunning this tutorial\n\n\n1) Clone the repo:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/OpenVidu/openvidu-tutorials.git\n\n\n\n\n1) You will need \nnode\n to execute the app. You can install them with:\n\n\nsudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\n\n\n3) Run the tutorial with the following commands. They will install the NPM dependencies and will execute \nserver.js\n server passing two arguments: \"localhost:4443\" as the URL where \nopenvidu-server\n will be listening and \"MY_SECRET\" as the secret share with it:\n\n\ncd openvidu-tutorials/openvidu-mvc-node\nnpm install\nnode server.js localhost:4443 MY_SECRET\n\n\n\n\n4) \nopenvidu-server\n and \nKurento Media Server\n must be up and running in your development machine. The easiest way is running this Docker container which wraps both of them (you will need \nDocker CE\n):\n\n\ndocker run -p 4443:4443 --rm -e openvidu.secret=MY_SECRET openvidu/openvidu-server-kms:2.6.0\n\n\n\n\n5) Go to \nhttps://localhost:5000\n to test the app once the server is running. The first time you use the docker container, an alert message will suggest you accept the self-signed certificate of \nopenvidu-server\n when you first try to join a video-call. To test two users in the same computer, use a standard window and an incognito window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using \nWindows\n, read this \nFAQ\n to properly run the tutorial\n\n\nTo learn \nsome tips\n to develop with OpenVidu, check this \nFAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the code\n\n\nThis is a very basic web application with a pretty simple JS/HTML/CSS frontend and a straightforward Node backend built with \nexpress\n that serves HTML files with a MVC approach, building the templates with the help of \nEmbedded JavaScript\n. OpenVidu assumes you can identify your users so you can tell which users can connect to which video-calls, and what role (and therefore what permissions) each one of them will have in the calls. You can do this as you prefer. Here our backend will manage the users and their sessions with the easy-to-use and non-intrusive \nexpress-session\n API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackend\n: node server\n\n\n\n\nserver.js\n : single file which handles all operations of server. It returns HTML templates as response to HTTP requests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend templates\n: Plain JS/HTML/CSS files served by the backend, with \n.ejs\n extension to support Embedded JavaScript (\n/views\n folder)\n\n\n\n\nindex.ejs\n : template with the login form\n\n\ndashboard.ejs\n : template with the form to join a video-call\n\n\nsession.ejs\n : template of the video-call itself\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend static files\n (\n/public\n folder)\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n : openvidu-browser library. You don't have to manipulate this file\n\n\nstyle.css\n : some CSS classes to style the templates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's describe the code following this scenario: a user logs in to the app and connects to the video-call \"TUTORIAL\", where he publishes his webcam. A second user will connect to the same video-call just after that and publish its own webcam. Both of them will leave the call after a while.\n\n\n\n\n1) User logs in\n\n\nAt path \n/\n a login form will be displayed:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe form will execute a POST operation to path \n/dashboard\n whenever \"Log in\" button is clicked, passing the username and the password:\n\n\nform class=\nform-group jumbotron\n action=\n/dashboard\n method=\npost\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nUser\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\ntext\n name=\nuser\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nPass\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\npassword\n name=\npass\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np class=\ntext-center\n\n        \nbutton class=\nbtn btn-lg btn-info\n type=\nsubmit\nLog in\n/button\n\n    \n/p\n\n\n/form\n\n\n\n\n\nserver.js\n at \n/dashboard\n first checks if the user is already logged (maybe he has just refreshed \n/dashboard\n page), and if so it just redirects to the dashboard itself. If the user is actually logging in, the method checks that the params are correct and if so sets a new \nexpress-session\n for the newly logged user (adding a \nloggedUser\n property with its username in the \nreq.session\n object). Finally it returns \ndashboard.ejs\n template:\n\n\napp.post('/dashboard', dashboardController);\napp.get('/dashboard', dashboardController);\n\nfunction dashboardController(req, res) {\n\n    // Check if the user is already logged in\n    if (isLogged(req.session)) {\n        // User is already logged. Immediately return dashboard\n        user = req.session.loggedUser;\n        res.render('dashboard.ejs', {\n            user: user\n        });\n    } else {\n        // User wasn't logged and wants to\n\n        // Retrieve params from POST body\n        var user = req.body.user;\n        var pass = req.body.pass;\n\n        if (login(user, pass)) { // Correct user-pass\n            // Validate session and return OK \n            // Value stored in req.session allows us to identify the user in future requests\n            req.session.loggedUser = user;\n            res.render('dashboard.ejs', {\n                user: user\n            });\n        } else { // Wrong user-pass\n            // Invalidate session and return index template\n            req.session.destroy();\n            res.redirect('/');\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) User connects to \"TUTORIAL\" video-call\n\n\ndashboard.ejs\n template will display a form asking for the video-call to connect and the nickname the user wants to have in it. So our 'publisher1' user would write TUTORIAL in \"Session\" field:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe form will execute a POST operation to path \n/session\n whenever \"Join!\" button is clicked, passing the nickname and the session name:\n\n\nform class=\nform-group\n action=\n/session\n method=\npost\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nParticipant\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\ntext\n name=\ndata\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nSession\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\ntext\n name=\nsessionname\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np class=\ntext-center\n\n        \nbutton class=\nbtn btn-lg btn-success\n type=\nsubmit\nJoin!\n/button\n\n    \n/p\n\n\n/form\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \nserver.js\n receives a request at \n/session\n path is when things get interesting.\nFirst of all there are some important attributes in this class we must mention:\n\n\n// Environment variable: URL where our OpenVidu server is listening\nvar OPENVIDU_URL = process.argv[2];\n// Environment variable: secret shared with our OpenVidu server\nvar OPENVIDU_SECRET = process.argv[3];\n\n// Entrypoint to OpenVidu Node Client SDK\nvar OV = new OpenVidu(OPENVIDU_URL, OPENVIDU_SECRET);\n\n// Collection to pair session names with OpenVidu Session objects\nvar mapSessions = {};\n// Collection to pair session names with tokens\nvar mapSessionNamesTokens = {};\n\n\n\n\nRest controller method receives both params sent by the client (whatever nickname the user has chosen and \"TUTORIAL\" as the sessionName). First it prepares a param we will need a little further on: \ntokenOptions\n.\n\n\napp.post('/session', (req, res) =\n {\n    // Check the user is logged ...\n\n    // The nickname sent by the client\n    var clientData = req.body.data;\n    // The video-call to connect\n    var sessionName = req.body.sessionname;\n\n    // Role associated to this user\n    var role = users.find(u =\n (u.user === req.session.loggedUser)).role;\n\n    // Optional data to be passed to other users when this user connects to the video-call\n    // In this case, a JSON with the value we stored in the req.session object on login\n    var serverData = JSON.stringify({ serverData: req.session.loggedUser });\n\n    // Build tokenOptions object with the serverData and the role\n    var tokenOptions = {\n        data: serverData,\n        role: role\n    };\n\n\n\n\nJust after that an \nif-else\n statement comes into play: does the session \"TUTORIAL\" already exist?\n\n\nif (mapSessions[sessionName]) { ...\n\n\n\n\nIn this case it doesn't because 'publisher1' is the first user connecting to it. So we focus on the \nelse\n branch:\n\n\nelse {\n// Create a new OpenVidu Session asynchronously\nOV.createSession()\n    .then(session =\n {\n        // Store the new Session in the collection of Sessions\n        mapSessions[sessionName] = session;\n        // Store a new empty array in the collection of tokens\n        mapSessionNamesTokens[sessionName] = [];\n\n        // Generate a new token asynchronously with the recently created tokenOptions\n        session.generateToken(tokenOptions)\n            .then(token =\n {\n\n                // Store the new token in the collection of tokens\n                mapSessionNamesTokens[sessionName].push(token);\n\n                // Return session template with all the needed attributes\n                res.render('session.ejs', {\n                    sessionName: sessionName,\n                    token: token,\n                    nickName: clientData,\n                    userName: req.session.loggedUser,\n                });\n            })\n            .catch(error =\n {\n                console.error(error);\n            });\n    })\n    .catch(error =\n {\n        console.error(error);\n    });\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe are almost there! Now in \nsession.ejs\n JavaScript code (preceded by a tag \nscript\n) we can init a new Session with \nsessionId\n and connect to it with \ntoken\n:\n\n\n// Get all the attributes from the template in EJS style\nvar sessionName = \n%- JSON.stringify(sessionName) %\n;\nvar token = \n%- JSON.stringify(token) %\n;\nvar nickName = \n%- JSON.stringify(nickName) %\n;\nvar userName = \n%- JSON.stringify(userName) %\n;\n\n\n\n\n// --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object ---\n\nOV = new OpenVidu();\n\n// --- 2) Init a session ---\n\nsession = OV.initSession();\n\n\n// --- 3) Specify the actions when events take place in the session ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nsession.on('streamCreated', (event) =\n {\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it\n    // HTML video will be appended to element with 'video-container' id\n    var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'video-container');\n\n    // When the HTML video has been appended to DOM...\n    subscriber.on('videoElementCreated', (event) =\n {\n\n        // Add a new HTML element for the user's name and nickname over its video\n        appendUserData(event.element, subscriber.stream.connection);\n    });\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nsession.on('streamDestroyed', (event) =\n {\n    // Delete the HTML element with the user's name and nickname\n    removeUserData(event.stream.connection);\n});\n\n\n// --- 4) Connect to the session passing the retrieved token and some more data from\n//        the client (in this case a JSON with the nickname chosen by the user) ---\n\nsession.connect(token, { clientData: nickName })\n    .then(() =\n {\n\n        // --- 5) Set page layout for active call ---\n\n        $('#session-title').text(sessionName);\n        $('#join').hide();\n        $('#session').show();\n\n        // Here we check somehow if the user has 'PUBLISHER' role before\n        // trying to publish its stream. Even if someone modified the client's code and\n        // published the stream, it wouldn't work if the token sent in Session.connect\n        // method is not recognized as 'PUBLIHSER' role by OpenVidu Server\n        if (isPublisher()) {\n\n            // --- 6) Get your own camera stream ---\n\n            var publisher = OV.initPublisher('video-container', {\n                audioSource: undefined, // The source of audio.

The connection to the session has completed!\n\n\n\n\n3) Another user connects to the video-call\n\n\nThe process would be exactly the same as before until \nserver.js\n executes controller at \n/session\n. Now session 'TUTORIAL' already exists, so in the \nif-else\n statement the \nif\n branch would be the one executed:\n\n\nif (mapSessions[sessionName]) {\n    // Session already exists: return existing sessionId and a new token\n\n    // Get the existing Session from the collection\n    var mySession = mapSessions[sessionName];\n\n    // Generate a new token asynchronously with the recently created tokenOptions\n    mySession.generateToken(tokenOptions)\n        .then(token =\n {\n\n            // Store the new token in the collection of tokens\n            mapSessionNamesTokens[sessionName].push(token);\n\n            // Return session template with all the needed attributes\n            res.render('session.ejs', {\n                sessionId: mySession.getSessionId(),\n                token: token,\n                nickName: clientData,\n                userName: req.session.loggedUser,\n                sessionName: sessionName\n            });\n        })\n        .catch(error =\n {\n            console.error(error);\n        });\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe code executed in \nsession.ejs\n \n script \n tag would also be the same. After the \nSession.publish()\n method has been successful, both users will be seeing each other's video, as well as the username and the nickname below it.\n\n\n\n\n4) Users leave the video-call\n\n\nAfter a while both users decide to leave the session. Apart from calling \nsession.disconnect()\n (triggered in \nleaveSession()\n \nonclick\n method) to destroy the connection on openvidu-server, we need another POST operation to let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens.\n\n\nIn \nsession.ejs\n template the \"Leave session\" button actually performs a POST operation to path \n/leave-session\n with a hidden form. Notice that when the user clicks the submit button, a POST operation will be triggered but also the \nleaveSession()\n method. First updates our backend. Second updates our openvidu-server.\n\n\nform action=\n/leave-session\n method=\npost\n\n    \ninput type=\nhidden\n name=\nsessionname\n value=\n%= sessionName %\n/input\n\n    \ninput type=\nhidden\n name=\ntoken\n value=\n%= token %\n/input\n\n    \nbutton id=\nbuttonLeaveSession\n class=\nbtn btn-large btn-danger\n type=\nsubmit\n onclick=\nleaveSession()\nLeave session\n/button\n\n\n/form\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \nserver.js\n we update the collections at \n/leave-session\n:\n\n\napp.post('/leave-session', (req, res) =\n {\n    // Check the user is logged ...\n\n    // Retrieve params from POST body\n    var sessionName = req.body.sessionname;\n    var token = req.body.token;\n\n    // If the session exists\n    if (mapSessions[sessionName] \n mapSessionNamesTokens[sessionName]) {\n        var tokens = mapSessionNamesTokens[sessionName];\n        var index = tokens.indexOf(token);\n\n        // If the token exists\n        if (index !== -1) {\n            // Token removed\n            tokens.splice(index, 1);\n        } else {\n            console.log('Problems in the app server: the TOKEN wasn\\'t valid');\n            res.redirect('/dashboard');\n        }\n        if (tokens.length == 0) {\n            // Last user left: session must be removed\n            delete mapSessions[sessionName];\n        }\n        res.redirect('/dashboard');\n    } else {\n        var msg = 'Problems in the app server: the SESSION does not exist';\n        res.status(500).send(msg);\n    }\n\n\n\n\nWhen the last user leaves the session \ndelete mapSessions[sessionName]\n will be executed: this means the session is empty and that it is going to be closed. The \nsessionId\n and all \ntoken\n params associated to it will be invalidated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point we have covered all the important code from the tutorial. With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches: \nyou can implement your frontend and your backend as you want\n. \n\n\nThe only actual requirements are getting \nsessionId\n and \ntoken\n params from  \nopenvidu-server\n (by using one of the available clients or with the REST API) and using them along with \nopenvidu-browser\n to connect your clients to the sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

Apart from calling  session.disconnect()  (triggered in  leaveSession()   onclick  method) to destroy the connection on openvidu-server, we need another POST operation to let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens.  In  session.ejs  template the \"Leave session\" button actually performs a POST operation to path  /leave-session  with a hidden form. Notice that when the user clicks the submit button, a POST operation will be triggered but also the  leaveSession()  method. First updates our backend. Second updates our openvidu-server.  form action= /leave-session  method= post \n     input type= hidden  name= sessionname  value= %= sessionName % /input \n     input type= hidden  name= token  value= %= token % /input \n     button id= buttonLeaveSession  class= btn btn-large btn-danger  type= submit  onclick= leaveSession() Leave session /button  /form   In  server.js  we update the collections at  /leave-session :  app.post('/leave-session', (req, res) =  {\n    // Check the user is logged ...\n\n    // Retrieve params from POST body\n    var sessionName = req.body.sessionname;\n    var token = req.body.token;\n\n    // If the session exists\n    if (mapSessions[sessionName]   mapSessionNamesTokens[sessionName]) {\n        var tokens = mapSessionNamesTokens[sessionName];\n        var index = tokens.indexOf(token);\n\n        // If the token exists\n        if (index !== -1) {\n            // Token removed\n            tokens.splice(index, 1);\n        } else {\n            console.log('Problems in the app server: the TOKEN wasn\\'t valid');\n            res.redirect('/dashboard');\n        }\n        if (tokens.length == 0) {\n            // Last user left: session must be removed\n            delete mapSessions[sessionName];\n        }\n        res.redirect('/dashboard');\n    } else {\n        var msg = 'Problems in the app server: the SESSION does not exist';\n        res.status(500).send(msg);\n    }  When the last user leaves the session  delete mapSessions[sessionName]  will be executed: this means the session is empty and that it is going to be closed. The  sessionId  and all  token  params associated to it will be invalidated.    At this point we have covered all the important code from the tutorial. With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches:  you can implement your frontend and your backend as you want .   The only actual requirements are getting  sessionId  and  token  params from   openvidu-server  (by using one of the available clients or with the REST API) and using them along with  openvidu-browser  to connect your clients to the sessions.     \n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

Configure your Sessions to be recorded\n\n\nSetting property \nopenvidu.recording\n to \ntrue\n only automatically enables recordings for insecure sessions (those directly created from the client side. See \nthis FAQ\n).\n\n\nIn order to record a regular securized session, it is necessary to explicitly configure it through the \nREST API\n or any of the server clients (\nopenvidu-java-client\n, \nopenvidu-node-client\n).\n\n\nRecording can be configured in two ways: \nautomatic recording\n or \nmanual recording\n:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic recording\n: your sessions will be recorded from the moment the first participant starts publishing media until the last participant leaves the session.\n\n\nManual recording\n: you will have to tell openvidu-server to start and to stop the recording. The recording will never be automatically stopped even though all participants leave the session (in fact the session will not be closed until the recording stops).\n\n\n\n\nAPI REST\n\n\n\n\nInitialize your sessions with this POST method: \nPOST /api/sessions\n. For sessions configured for automatic recording no more steps are needed\n\n\nIf you have configured your session for manual recording\n\n\nStart the recording with this POST method: \nPOST /api/recordings/start\n\n\nStop the recording with this POST method: \nPOST /api/recordings/stop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-java-client\n\n\nCall \nOpenVidu.createSession()\n passing as optional parameter a \nSessionProperties\n object properly configured:\n\n\nOpenVidu openvidu = new OpenVidu(OPENVIDU_URL, OPENVIDU_SECRET);\nSessionProperties properties = new SessionProperties.Builder()\n    .recordingMode(RecordingMode.MANUAL) // RecordingMode.ALWAYS for automatic recording\n    .defaultRecordingLayout(RecordingLayout.BEST_FIT)\n    .mediaMode(MediaMode.ROUTED)\n    .build();\nSession session = openVidu.createSession(properties);\n\n\n\n\nIf Session is configured with \nRecordingMode.MANUAL\n:\n\n\nRecording recording = openVidu.startRecording(session.getSessionId()); // Starts recording\nrecording = openVidu.stopRecording(recording.getId()); // Stops recording\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-node-client\n\n\nCall \nOpenVidu.createSession()\n passing as optional parameter a \nSessionProperties\n object properly configured:\n\n\nvar openvidu = new OpenVidu(OPENVIDU_URL, OPENVIDU_SECRET);\nvar properties = {\n    recordingMode: RecordingMode.MANUAL, // RecordingMode.ALWAYS for automatic recording\n    defaultRecordingLayout: RecordingLayout.BEST_FIT,\n    mediaMode: MediaMode.ROUTED\n};\nvar mySession = openvidu.createSession(properties);\n\n\n\n\nIf Session is configured with \nRecordingMode.MANUAL\n:\n\n\nvar recording;\n\nopenvidu.startRecording(sessionId) // Starts recording\n.then(response =\n {\n    recording = response;\n})\n.catch(error =\n console.error(error));\n\nopenvidu.stopRecording(recording.id) // Stops recording\n.then(response =\n {\n    recording = response;\n})\n.catch(error =\n console.error(error));\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom recording layouts\n\n\nYou can create your own layouts for the session recording process. They are implemented with HTML/CSS/JS files, just as your OpenVidu application client-side.\n\n\n1. Create your layout with HTML/CSS/JS files\n\n\nPut them in a path accessible to openvidu-server. There must be an \nindex.html\n file as entrypoint for your custom layout:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT SHOULD YOUR JS CODE DO\n: by making use of \nopenvidu-browser.js\n library, you need to connect a \nrecorder\n participant to the session. This means:\n\n\n1) Your layout must connect to the session using a \ntoken\n like this:\n\n\n'wss://' + location.hostname + ':4443?sessionId=' + SESSION_ID + '\nsecret=' + SECRET + '\nrecorder=true';\n\n\n\nBeing \nSESSION_ID\n and \nSECRET\n two parameters that will be url-encoded under ids \nsessionId\n and \nsecret\n respectively. So, for example:\n\n\nvar url = new URL(window.location.href);\nvar SESSION_ID = url.searchParams.get(\"sessionId\");\nvar SECRET = url.searchParams.get(\"secret\");\nvar TOKEN = 'wss://' + location.hostname + ':4443?sessionId=' + SESSION_ID + '\nsecret=' + SECRET + '\nrecorder=true';\nvar session = OV.initSession();\nsession.connect(TOKEN);\n\n\n\n2) You will need to subscribe to, at least, one event:\n \nstreamCreated\n of Session object. That way you can subscribe your recorder to every stream when any user starts publishing (by default, the video element will be automatically removed on every \nstreamDestroyed\n event). To sum up, this would be the simplest code you need to properly start your recorder participant:\n\n\nvar OV = new OpenVidu();\n\nvar url = new URL(window.location.href);\nvar SESSION_ID = url.searchParams.get(\"sessionId\");\nvar SECRET = url.searchParams.get(\"secret\");\nvar TOKEN = 'wss://' + location.hostname + ':4443?sessionId=' + SESSION_ID + '\nsecret=' + SECRET + '\nrecorder=true';\nvar session = OV.initSession();\n\nsession.on(\"streamCreated\", (event) =\n {\n    session.subscribe(event.stream, 'html-id-where-insert-video');\n});\n\nsession.connect(TOKEN);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO IDENTIFY YOUR USERS\n: you can identify them by making use of property \nStream.connection.data\n of the Stream object retrieved in Session event \"streamCreated\". That way you may know which particular user should be displayed in which particular HTML element of your layout. For example:\nsession.on(\"streamCreated\", (event) =\n {\n    var stream = event.stream;\n    if (stream.connection.data === 'userBigVideo') {\n        session.subscribe(stream, 'big-video-div');\n    } else if (stream.connection.data === 'userSmallVideo') {\n        session.subscribe(stream, 'small-video-div');\n    }\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Add new properties when launching openvidu-server\n\n\nOn the one hand a new property \nopenvidu.recording.custom-layout\n and on the other hand, if using Docker images, a new \n-v\n option:\n\n\nopenvidu-server.jar\n\n\njava -jar \\\n    -Dopenvidu.recording=true \\\n    -Dopenvidu.recording.path=/PATH/TO/VIDEO/FILES \\\n    -Dopenvidu.recording.public-access=true \\\n    -Dopenvidu.recording.custom-layout: /PATH/TO/INDEX/CUSTOM/LAYOUT \\\nopenvidu-server.jar\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu/openvidu-server-kms\n\n\ndocker run -p 4443:4443 --rm \\\n    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n    -v /PATH/TO/VIDEO/FILES:/PATH/TO/VIDEO/FILES \\\n    -v /PATH/TO/INDEX/CUSTOM/LAYOUT:/PATH/TO/INDEX/CUSTOM/LAYOUT \\\n    -e MY_UID=$(id -u $USER) \\\n    -e openvidu.recording=true \\\n    -e openvidu.recording.path=/PATH/TO/VIDEO/FILES \\\n    -e openvidu.recording.custom-layout=/PATH/TO/INDEX/CUSTOM/LAYOUT \\\nopenvidu/openvidu-server-kms\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu/openvidu-server\n (KMS up and running in the host machine)\n\n\ndocker run --net=\nhost\n --rm \\\n    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n    -v /PATH/TO/VIDEO/FILES:/PATH/TO/VIDEO/FILES \\\n    -v /PATH/TO/INDEX/CUSTOM/LAYOUT:/PATH/TO/INDEX/CUSTOM/LAYOUT \\\n    -e MY_UID=$(id -u $USER) \\\n    -e openvidu.recording=true \\\n    -e openvidu.recording.path=/PATH/TO/VIDEO/FILES \\\n    -e openvidu.recording.custom-layout=/PATH/TO/INDEX/CUSTOM/LAYOUT \\\nopenvidu/openvidu-server-kms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Configure your sessions to use your custom layout\n\n\nDo exactly the same process explained \nhere\n, but changing \ndefaultRecordingLayout\n from \nBEST_FIT\n to \nCUSTOM\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using the \nAPI REST\n, just change json body parameter \n\"defaultRecordingLayout\":\"BEST_FIT\"\n to \n\"defaultRecordingLayout\":\"CUSTOM\"\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using \nopenvidu-java-client\n change\n\n\nSessionProperties.Builder().defaultRecordingLayout(RecordingLayout.BEST_FIT)\n\n\nto\n\n\nSessionProperties.Builder().defaultRecordingLayout(RecordingLayout.CUSTOM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using \nopenvidu-node-client\n change property \ndefaultRecordingLayout\n of \nSessionProperties\n from\n\n\n{ defaultRecordingLayout: RecordingLayout.BEST_FIT }\n\n\nto\n\n\n{ defaultRecordingLayout: RecordingLayout.CUSTOM }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring multiple custom layouts\n\n\nYou can implement as many custom recording layouts as you want. Simply store each one of them (each one with its own \nindex.html\n entrypoint file) in a subfolder under path \n/PATH/TO/INDEX/CUSTOM/LAYOUT\n. Then, when configuring your sessions as stated above in point 3, just add a new parameter besides changing \ndefaultRecordingLayout\n property:\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using the \nAPI REST\n, add an additional field to json body: \n\"defaultRecordingLayout\":\"CUSTOM\", \"defaultCustomLayout\":\"RELATIVE/PATH/TO/INDEX\"\n\n\nIf you are using \nopenvidu-java-client\n, create SessionProperties object with a new step: \nnew SessionProperties.Builder().defaultRecordingLayout(RecordingLayout.CUSTOM).defaultCustomLayout(\"RELATIVE/PATH/TO/INDEX\").build())\n\n\nIf you are using \nopenvidu-node-client\n, create SessionProperties object with a new property: \n{defaultRecordingLayout: RecordingLayout.CUSTOM, defaultCustomLayout: \"RELATIVE/PATH/TO/INDEX\"}\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPath \nRELATIVE/PATH/TO/INDEX\n is the path from openvidu-server configuration property \nopenvidu.recording.custom-layout\n to the specific \nindex.html\n you want to use for a particular session recording. So, if you have the following folder tree structure:\n\n\n/opt\n+-- /openvidu\n|   +-- /my_custom_layouts\n|       +-- index.html\n|       +-- /layout1\n|           +-- index.html\n|       +-- /layout2\n|           +-- index.html\n/etc\n    ...\n\n\n\n\nYou should start openvidu-server with property \nopenvidu.recording.custom-layout=/opt/openvidu/my_custom_layouts\n and you can use any of the 3 \nindex.html\n files for recording any of your sessions. To use the outer layout, just configure \ndefaultRecordingLayout\n to \nCUSTOM\n. To use any of the inner layouts, also configure \ndefaultCustomLayout\n to \nlayout1\n or \nlayout2\n.\n\n\n\n\nSample custom layout\n\n\nThis is literally the simplest HTML for a custom recording layout. Use it as a template for building more complex ones.\n\n\nhtml\n\n\n\nhead\nscript src=\nopenvidu-browser-2.0.0.min.js\n/script\n/head\n\n\n\nbody\n\n    \ndiv id=\nvideos\n/div\n\n\n/body\n\n\n\nscript\n\n    var url = new URL(window.location.href);\n    var SESSION_ID = url.searchParams.get(\nsessionId\n);\n    var SECRET = url.searchParams.get(\nsecret\n);\n    var TOKEN = 'wss://' + location.hostname + ':4443?sessionId=' + SESSION_ID + '\nsecret=' + SECRET + '\nrecorder=true';\n\n    var OV = new OpenVidu();\n    var session = OV.initSession();\n\n    session.on(\nstreamCreated\n, (event) =\n {\n        session.subscribe(event.stream, 'videos');\n    });\n    session.connect(TOKEN)\n        .then(() =\n { console.log('Recorder participant connected') })\n        .catch(error =\n { console.error(error) });\n\n/script\n\n\n\n/html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal recording\n\n\nOpenVidu Browser offers an extremely simple API to record Streams directly in the client's browser.

There must be an  index.html  file as entrypoint for your custom layout:     WHAT SHOULD YOUR JS CODE DO : by making use of  openvidu-browser.js  library, you need to connect a  recorder  participant to the session. This means:  1) Your layout must connect to the session using a  token  like this:  'wss://' + location.hostname + ':4443?sessionId=' + SESSION_ID + ' secret=' + SECRET + ' recorder=true';  Being  SESSION_ID  and  SECRET  two parameters that will be url-encoded under ids  sessionId  and  secret  respectively. So, for example:  var url = new URL(window.location.href);\nvar SESSION_ID = url.searchParams.get(\"sessionId\");\nvar SECRET = url.searchParams.get(\"secret\");\nvar TOKEN = 'wss://' + location.hostname + ':4443?sessionId=' + SESSION_ID + ' secret=' + SECRET + ' recorder=true';\nvar session = OV.initSession();\nsession.connect(TOKEN);  2) You will need to subscribe to, at least, one event:   streamCreated  of Session object. That way you can subscribe your recorder to every stream when any user starts publishing (by default, the video element will be automatically removed on every  streamDestroyed  event). To sum up, this would be the simplest code you need to properly start your recorder participant:  var OV = new OpenVidu();\n\nvar url = new URL(window.location.href);\nvar SESSION_ID = url.searchParams.get(\"sessionId\");\nvar SECRET = url.searchParams.get(\"secret\");\nvar TOKEN = 'wss://' + location.hostname + ':4443?sessionId=' + SESSION_ID + ' secret=' + SECRET + ' recorder=true';\nvar session = OV.initSession();\n\nsession.on(\"streamCreated\", (event) =  {\n    session.subscribe(event.stream, 'html-id-where-insert-video');\n});\n\nsession.connect(TOKEN);      HOW TO IDENTIFY YOUR USERS : you can identify them by making use of property  Stream.connection.data  of the Stream object retrieved in Session event \"streamCreated\". That way you may know which particular user should be displayed in which particular HTML element of your layout. For example: session.on(\"streamCreated\", (event) =  {\n    var stream = event.stream;\n    if (stream.connection.data === 'userBigVideo') {\n        session.subscribe(stream, 'big-video-div');\n    } else if (stream.connection.data === 'userSmallVideo') {\n        session.subscribe(stream, 'small-video-div');\n    }\n});",

All JSON entries have the following structure:\n\n\n{\"EVENT_NAME\": {\"sessionId\": \"SESSION_ID\", \"timestamp\": TIMESTAMP, \"PROP_1\": \"VALUE_1\",\"PROP_2\": \"VALUE_2\", ... }}\n\n\nSo every entry is a JSON object identified by a specific event name, and all of them have as properties the \nsessionId\n identifying the video-session for which this event was registered and the \ntimestamp\n. Besides this two common properties, there are custom properties for every specific event with useful information. The complete list of possible JSON entries is available below:\n\n\n\n\n\nsessionCreated\n\n\nRecorded when a new session has been created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsessionId\n\n\nSession for which the event was triggered\n\n\nA string with the session unique identifier\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\n\n\nTime when the event was triggered\n\n\nUTC milliseconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n{\nsessionCreated\n:{\nsessionId\n:\nfds4e07mdug1ga3h\n,\ntimestamp\n:1538481330577}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsessionDestroyed\n\n\nRecorded when a session has finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsessionId\n\n\nSession for which the event was triggered\n\n\nA string with the session unique identifier\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\n\n\nTime when the event was triggered\n\n\nUTC milliseconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstartTime\n\n\nTime when the session started\n\n\nUTC milliseconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nduration\n\n\nTotal duration of the session\n\n\nSeconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreason\n\n\nWhy the session was destroyed\n\n\n[\n\"lastParticipantLeft\"\n,\n\"sessionClosedByServer\"\n,\n\"openviduServerStopped\"\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n{\nsessionDestroyed\n:{\nsessionId\n:\nfds4e07mdug1ga3h\n,\ntimestamp\n:1538481699154,\nstartTime\n:1538481330577,\nduration\n:368,\nreason\n:\nlastParticipantLeft\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparticipantJoined\n\n\nRecorded when a user has connected to a session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsessionId\n\n\nSession for which the event was triggered\n\n\nA string with the session unique identifier\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\n\n\nTime when the event was triggered\n\n\nUTC milliseconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparticipantId\n\n\nIdentifier of the participant\n\n\nA string with the participant unique identifier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlocation\n\n\nGeo location of the participant \n(ONLY IN OPENVIDU PRO)\n\n\nA string with format \n\"CITY, COUNTRY\"\n (or \n\"unknown\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplatform\n\n\nComplete description of the platform used by the participant to connect to the session\n\n\nA string with the platform description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n{\nparticipantJoined\n:{\nsessionId\n:\nfds4e07mdug1ga3h\n,\ntimestamp\n:1538481330760,\nparticipantId\n:\nwsalcr1r72goj8sk\n,\nlocation\n:\nBerlin, Germany\n,\nplatform\n:\nChrome 69.0.3497.81 on OS X 10.13.6 64-bit\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparticipantLeft\n\n\nRecorded when a user has left a session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsessionId\n\n\nSession for which the event was triggered\n\n\nA string with the session unique identifier\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\n\n\nTime when the event was triggered\n\n\nUTC milliseconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparticipantId\n\n\nIdentifier of the participant\n\n\nA string with the participant unique identifier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlocation\n\n\nGeo location of the participant \n(ONLY IN OPENVIDU PRO)\n\n\nA string with format \n\"CITY, COUNTRY\"\n (or \n\"unknown\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplatform\n\n\nComplete description of the platform used by the participant to connect to the session\n\n\nA string with the platform description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstartTime\n\n\nTime when the participant joined the session\n\n\nUTC milliseconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nduration\n\n\nTotal duration of the participant's connection to the session\n\n\nSeconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreason\n\n\nHow the participant left the session\n\n\n[\n\"disconnect\"\n,\n\"forceDisconnectByUser\"\n,\n\"forceDisconnectByServer\"\n,\n\"sessionClosedByServer\"\n,\n\"networkDisconnect\"\n,\n\"openviduServerStopped\"\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n{\nparticipantLeft\n:{\nsessionId\n:\nfds4e07mdug1ga3h\n,\ntimestamp\n:1538481597612,\nstartTime\n:1538481532507,\nduration\n:65,\nreason\n:\ndisconnect\n,\nparticipantId\n:\nlgge40niviipjzwg\n,\nlocation\n:\nBerlin, Germany\n,\nplatform\n:\nChrome 69.0.3497.81 on OS X 10.13.6 64-bit\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwebrtcConnectionCreated\n\n\nRecorded when a new media stream has been established.

You can now add your own application to your instance. To learn how check the \nnext section\n.\n\n\nAdding your own app to CloudFormation OpenVidu Server\n\n\nOnce you have deployed your CloudFormation OpenVidu Server and checked that it is up and running, you can easily add your own application to the instance. Follow these steps:\n\n\n1. Upload your app to your EC2 instance\n\n\nIn Linux/Mac you can use \nscp\n command. In Windows (or If you prefer a more friendly GUI) you can use \nFileZilla\n. Furthermore, if your app is stored in a GitHub repo, you can directly clone it once you connect to your instance.\n\n\nRemember that the key will be the same you indicated when configuring the \nCloudFormation fields\n. \n\n\n2. Connect to your EC2 instance through SSH\n\n\nRemember that the key will be the same you indicated when configuring the \nCloudFormation fields\n. In case of doubt, check \nAWS docs\n.\n\n\n3. Configure your app\n\n\nDepending on the framework of your app:\n\n\n\n\nPlain HTML/CSS/JS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your app doesn't have a server-side and it is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you just have to add your web files into \n/var/www/html/\n. You will have instant access to it through \nhttps://AMAZON_URL_OR_YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN/\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to test the deployment of a plain HTML/CSS/JS app, you can use \nopenvidu-insecure-js\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJava\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy your JAR or WAR into \n/opt/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a script to launch your app with all the parameters it needs, and store it under \n/opt/\n. For example, a file \n/opt/YOUR_LAUNCHER.sh\n containing:\n\n\ncd /opt\njava -jar -Dserver.port=4040 myapp.jar\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT 1\n: It is crucial to navigate to \n/opt\n before the launching command. Otherwise, the system will surely have some problems for finding your files\n\n\nIMPORTANT 2\n: Obviously your app will need Java to run. You must install the correct version of Java in your machine (check version: \njava -version\n)\n\n\nIMPORTANT 3\n: Make sure the script you made is executable.(For Linux you could do like this \nchmod +x YOUR_LAUNCHER.sh\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Nginx: add a new \nlocation\n directive to the file \n/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n, inside the \nserver { }\n group:\n\n\n  location / {\n    rewrite /(.*) /$1 break;\n    proxy_pass https://localhost:PORT;\n  }\n\n\n\nFor example\n\n\n  location / {\n    rewrite /(.*) /$1 break;\n    proxy_pass https://localhost:4040;\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Supervisor: add the script you wrote in the second step to the file \n/etc/supervisor/conf.d/openvidu.conf\n like this:\n\n\n  [program:YOUR_APP]\n  command=/bin/bash /opt/YOUR_LAUNCHER.sh YOUR_APP_PARAM_1 YOUR_APP_PARAM_2 ...\n  redirect_stderr=true\n\n\n\nNow your \n/etc/supervisor/conf.d/openvidu.conf\n must looks like this:\n\n\n  [supervisord]\n  nodaemon=true\n  logfile=/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log\n  pidfile=/var/run/supervisord.pid\n  loglevel=debug\n\n  [program:openvidu-server]\n  command=java -jar -Dopenvidu.secret=\"MY_SECRET\" -Dserver.ssl.enabled=false -Dopenvidu.pu$\n\n  [program:YOUR_APP]\n  command=/bin/bash /opt/YOUR_LAUNCHER.sh YOUR_APP_PARAM_1 YOUR_APP_PARAM_2 ...\n  redirect_stderr=true\n\n\n\n\n\nTo connect your Java app to OpenVidu Server in order to get your sessionIds and tokens (whether you use the \nREST API\n or \nopenvidu-java-client\n), you will need to use the URL \nhttps://localhost:4443\n. \nlocalhost\n because both your app and OpenVidu Server run in the same machine. \n4443\n because there's where OpenVidu Server listens for petitions. For example, our tutorial \nopenvidu-js-java\n sets this parameter as an environment variable \nright here\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart Nginx: \nsystemctl restart nginx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart Supervisor: \nsystemctl restart supervisor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will have access to your app through \nhttps://AMAZON_URL_OR_YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting: If your app is not working as expected, there are a few files you should check for debugging: \n/var/log/nginx/\n (info about the proxy), \n/var/log/supervisor/\n (output of your app). You can also try to connect to your app directly through the port like \nhttps://AMAZON_URL_OR_YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN:YOUR_APP_PORT\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to test the deployment of a Java app, you can use \nopenvidu-js-java\n or \nopenvidu-mvc-java\n (\nrelease here\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd your web files into \n/opt/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a script to launch your app with all the parameters it needs, and store it under \n/opt/\n. For example, a file \n/opt/YOUR_LAUNCHER.sh\n containing:\n\n\ncd /opt\nnode myserver.js 4040\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT 1\n: It is crucial to navigate to \n/opt\n before the launching command. Otherwise, the system will surely have some problems for finding your files\n\n\nIMPORTANT 2\n: Obviously your app will need Node to run. You must install the correct version of Node in your machine (check version: \nnodejs -v\n)\n\n\nIMPORTANT 3\n: Make sure the script you made is executable.(For Linux you could do like this \nchmod +x YOUR_LAUNCHER.sh\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Nginx: add a new \nlocation\n directive to the file \n/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n, inside the \nserver { }\n group::\n\n\n  location / {\n    rewrite /(.*) /$1 break;\n    proxy_pass https://localhost:PORT;\n  }\n\n\n\nFor example\n\n\n  location / {\n    rewrite /(.*) /$1 break;\n    proxy_pass https://localhost:4040;\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart Nginx: \nsystemctl restart nginx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Supervisor: add the script you wrote in the second step to \n/etc/supervisor/conf.d/openvidu.conf\n like this:\n\n\n  [program:YOUR_APP]\n  command=/bin/bash /opt/YOUR_LAUNCHER.sh YOUR_APP_PARAM_1 YOUR_APP_PARAM_2 ...\n  redirect_stderr=true\n\n\n\nNow your \n/etc/supervisor/conf.d/openvidu.conf\n must looks like this:\n\n\n  [supervisord]\n  nodaemon=true\n  logfile=/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log\n  pidfile=/var/run/supervisord.pid\n  loglevel=debug\n\n  [program:openvidu-server]\n  command=java -jar -Dopenvidu.secret=\"MY_SECRET\" -Dserver.ssl.enabled=false -Dopenvidu.pu$\n\n  [program:YOUR_APP]\n  command=/bin/bash /opt/YOUR_LAUNCHER.sh YOUR_APP_PARAM_1 YOUR_APP_PARAM_2 ...\n  redirect_stderr=true\n\n\n\n\n\nTo connect your Node app to OpenVidu Server in order to get your sessionIds and tokens (whether you use the \nREST API\n or \nopenvidu-node-client\n), you will need to use the URL \nhttps://localhost:4443\n. \nlocalhost\n because both your app and OpenVidu Server run in the same machine. \n4443\n because there's where OpenVidu Server listens for petitions.

You can also try to connect to your app directly through the port like \nhttps://AMAZON_URL_OR_YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN:YOUR_APP_PORT\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to test the deployment of a Node app, you can use \nopenvidu-js-node\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHP, Ruby, Python, .NET...\n\n\nWe are not going to spell out in detail what is to be done with the rest of backend technologies, but you can get the idea from the Java and Node steps above. It is always the same process: take your app to your instance, place it under \n/opt/\n, configure Nginx and Supervisor (this last with the necessary launching script depending on your technology) and relaunch both services. Be sure that your machine has all the necessary dependencies and technologies to execute your application, depending on the framework (Java for a Java app, Node for a Node app, Ruby for a Ruby app...)\n\n\nVoil\u00e0! It is really this simple.\n\n\nPS: Multiple apps in the same instance\n\n\nTo launch multiple apps in the same instance, just store each one of them inside its own folder under \n/opt/\n. For example:\n\n\n\n\n/opt/YOUR_APP_1\n : will be available at \nhttps://AMAZON_URL_OR_YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN/YOUR_APP_1/\n\n\n/opt/YOUR_APP_2\n : will be available at \nhttps://AMAZON_URL_OR_YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN/YOUR_APP_2/\n\n\n\n\nThe other steps explained above also need some adjustments related to paths:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Nginx: now it would be...\n\n\nlocation /YOUR_APP_1 {\n  rewrite /YOUR_APP_1(.*) /$1 break;\n  proxy_pass https://localhost:PORT1;\n}\n\nlocation /YOUR_APP_2 {\n  rewrite /YOUR_APP_2(.*) /$1 break;\n  proxy_pass https://localhost:PORT2;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Supervisor: now...\n\n\n  [program:YOUR_APP_1]\n  command=/bin/bash /opt/YOUR_APP_1/YOUR_LAUNCHER_1.sh YOUR_APP1_PARAM_1 YOUR_APP1_PARAM_2 ...\n  redirect_stderr=true\n\n  [program:YOUR_APP_2]\n  command=/bin/bash /opt/YOUR_APP_2/YOUR_LAUNCHER_2.sh YOUR_APP2_PARAM_1 YOUR_APP2_PARAM_2 ...\n  redirect_stderr=true\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting your external app to CloudFormation OpenVidu Server\n\n\nThe best production setup for OpenVidu is having your application deployed in a different dedicated server. That is, not being included in the same host as OpenVidu Server, which is the scenario explained in the \nprevious section\n (that all-in-one scenario is easier for the first approach to the deployment of your OpenVidu app. Try it if you want detailed instructions on how to deploy your app).\n\n\nOnce you have deployed your CloudFormation OpenVidu Server and checked that it is up and running, and after setting up your own application in its dedicated server:\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you know your \nOpenVidu Server public IP\n. That includes the protocol (\nhttps\n), the location and the port. For example: \nhttps://YOUR_SERVER_IP:4443/\n\n\nUse it in your application server to perform the \nREST\n operations, or to initialize your OpenVidu object if you are making use of \nopenvdiu-java-client\n or \nopenvidu-node-client\n :\n\n\nREST\n operations to \nhttps://OPENVIDUSERVER_PUBLIC_IP/api/METHOD\n \n\n\nopenvidu-java-client\n entrypoint is \nnew OpenVidu(OPENVIDUSERVER_PUBLIC_IP, OPENVIDU_SECRET)\n\n\nopenvidu-node-client\n entrypoint is \nnew OpenVidu(OPENVIDUSERVER_PUBLIC_IP, OPENVIDU_SECRET)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the one-server-scenario of the \nprevious section\n the OpenVidu Server public IP would be \nhttps://localhost:4443\n, as both OpenVidu Server and your app live in the same host.",

What are the advantages and disadvantages of each one of them? Well, it really depends on the power of the machine, the nature of your application and the load expected. In general, having all the services running in one machine will reduce its performance and scalability, but on the other hand, makes it easier the process of installation, configuration and launching.\n\n\nIf you are deploying with these instructions for the first time, we recommend using only one machine.

It's very similar to the process outlined above:\n\n\nYou will need a server for the built app (if you don't have any, we recommend \nhttp-server\n):\n\nnpm install -g http-server\n\n\nRun exactly the same commands as the process above, but on step \n6)\n skip \nng serve\n. We don't want Angular-CLI to serve our app. Instead, these commands will be the ones which you should launch (and relaunch to update your changes):\n\n\nopenvidu/openvidu-testapp/\n\n\nng build -op ./dist\ncd dist\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -subj '/CN=www.mydom.com/O=My Company LTD./C=US' -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem\nhttp-server -S\n\n\n\n\nThis builds the Angular project, generate a self-signed certificate (which unfortunately is a mandatory requirement for http-server SSL) and serves the content with http-server.\n\n\nFinally, to launch the app connect to \nhttps://localhost:8080\n in the machine running the http-server and to \nhttps://[HOST]:8080\n in other devices of the same network (\n[HOST]\n being the IP of the machine running the http-server).\n\n\n\n\nInstalling KMS\n\n\nHow to \ninstall\n and \nrun\n KMS in your development machine:\n\n\nUbuntu 14.04 LTS Trusty (64 bits)\n\n\nsudo echo \ndeb http://ubuntu.openvidu.io/6.8.1 trusty kms6\n | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kurento.list\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 5AFA7A83\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y install kurento-media-server\n\n\n\n\nUbuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial (64 bits)\n\n\nsudo echo \ndeb http://ubuntu.openvidu.io/6.8.1 xenial kms6\n | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kurento.list\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 5AFA7A83\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y install kurento-media-server\n\n\n\n\nStart and stop the service\n\n\nsudo service kurento-media-server start\nsudo service kurento-media-server stop\n\n\n\n\nHere\n you can check Kurento's official documentation.",

Everything looks alright, but I cannot see any remote video\n\n\nYou have an app that uses OpenVidu to stream some video user-to-user, and the process looks perfectly okey. No errors on the console and all the OpenVidu events you are subscribed to are correctly triggered. So what's happening?\n\n\n99% of the time this is a problem related with \nOPENVIDU SERVER NOT HAVING A PUBLIC IP\n. To learn more about it, you can check \nthis FAQ\n. The quickest solution to this problem is to deploy in Amazon our ready-to-use OpenVidu Server with \nCloudFormation\n.\n\n\nIf you are a bit reluctant to this quick solution with Amazon CloudFormation, you can always deploy OpenVidu by yourself in Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04. Check \nDeploying OpenVidu as a native service\n section to learn how to properly do it.\n\n\nBesides that, these are the recommended steps to follow when videos are not received:\n\n\n\n\nAccess your OpenVidu dashboard (\nhttps://YOUR_OPENVIDU_IP:4443\n) to quickly test the video transmission (user: \nOPENVIDUAPP\n, pass: \n[your private secret]\n)\n\n\nPlease be sure that your OpenVidu Server host meets the \nnetwork requirements\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe other 1% of the time this can be an attempt of \naccessing the same camera from two different browsers at the same time\n. Remember that Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari are distinct processes which cannot generally access the same physical resource (as a webcam) at the same time on your computer. On the other hand, accessing the camera from different tabs of the same browser is tipically possible.\n\n\n\n\n2. Any tips to make easier the development of my app with OpenVidu?\n\n\nYou can do some things to improve your efficiency while using OpenVidu:\n\n\n\n\nMultiple tabs to test the video transmission\n\n\nYou can use multiple tabs in the same browser to test your video streams.\n\n\nWARNING\n: you may have trouble for testing with tabs from different browsers at the same time, as they compete for the camera access.\n\n\n\n\nBe very aware of the browser's console\n\n\nThere you can find logs reporting important stuff. Error messages can help you to solve many issues.\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      OpenVidu Browser is developed with both \nChrome\n (first image) and \nFirefox\n (second image) in mind in terms of logging. By default the browser's console displays OpenVidu's high-level messages (that's when the option 'Info' is enabled, as seen in the images). This means logs about OpenVidu objects being created and destroyed and logs for each triggered event (only for those you are subscribed to).\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n      Warn and Error messages are specifically reserved for unwanted situations, and you should check your code in case you spot one of them.\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n      If you enable the lowest level of logging you can see all the messages concerning the WebRTC negotiation process (generally not very interesting for an OpenVidu user).\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember the browser's cache\n\n\nIf you have changed your HTML, JavaScript or CSS code, refreshed the page and cannot see the changes on the browser, probably the cache is still serving the old files. To perform a hard reload of your page on the browser, press \nCtrl + Shift + R\n\n\n\n\nUse \nNgrok\n to share your app\n\n\nDo you want to be able to publish your development app over your network or even the Internet, without really having to deploy it in a server? This can be very helpful, as you can test with different devices and browsers at the same time. To achieve this, you can use \nNgrok\n. The set up for Ubuntu is quite simple:\n\n\n\n\nDownload \nNgrok\n with this link [\nLINK\n] and unzip it.\n\n\nDownload this \nNgrok\n configuration file (named \nngrok.yml\n) from our GitHub repo \n[\nLINK\n]\n and place it in the same path as \nNgrok\n binary.\n\n\nRun \nNgrok\n with this command: \n./ngrok start --all -config=ngrok.yml\n. You will get two public IPs (ended with \n.ngrok.io\n) publishing your local address \nlocalhost:5000\n and \nlocalhost:3000\n.\n\n\nYou just have to run you app at port \n3000\n and run OpenVidu Server locally adding this parameter:\n\n\nWhen running OpenVidu Server as a Docker container: \n-e spring.profiles.active=ngrok\n\n\nWhen running OpenVidu Server as a JAR: \n-Dspring.profiles.active=ngrok\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's it! Now you can connect to your app through the \nNgrok\n public IP and the connection to OpenVidu Server will work just fine. You have \"deployed\" your app on your own computer, and cross-device testing through your own network is now possible. Connecting to your app over the Internet is also possible, but the video transmission may not work (check \nthis FAQ\n to learn why).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. I am using Windows to run the tutorials / develop my app. Anything I should know?\n\n\nYes, some little changes are needed because of the way Docker runs on Windows. In Linux/Mac, Docker containers are easily accesible through \nlocalhost\n, but in Windows you will have to use the specific IP allocated to your container (usually \n192.168.99.100\n). To let your applications know how to connect to OpenVidu Server:\n\n\nApplications \nClient-Side Only\n\n\n(Tutorials \nopenvidu-hello-world\n, \nopenvidu-insecure-js\n, \nopenvidu-insecure-angular\n, \nopenvidu-getaroom\n)\n\n\nWhen consuming openvidu-server REST api, change \nlocation.hostname\n to the IP of the Docker container running openvidu-server (usually \n192.168.99.100\n). For every one of the insecure tutorials listed above, the url where to send the REST operations ...\n\n\n\"https://\" + location.hostname + \":4443/api/\nOPERATION\n\"\n\n\n\n... in Windows is ...\n\n\n\"https://192.168.99.100:4443/api/\nOPERATION\n\"\n\n\n\nChange this url in every insecure tutorial right here:\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-hello-world\n: \nhere\n\n\nopenvidu-insecure-js\n: \nhere\n\n\nopenvidu-insecure-angular\n: \nhere\n\n\nopenvidu-getaroom\n: \nhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso you will need to serve your apps over \nhttps\n. Browsers only accept camera usage on http when the address is \nlocalhost\n, and here it will be \n192.168.99.100\n or the one that Docker picks up for you. To serve over https with \nhttp-server\n, generate a self-signed certificate and run with \n-S\n flag on the root path of your app:\n\n\nGenerate a selfsigned certificate (run in  your Docker console)\n\n\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -subj '/CN=www.mydom.com/O=My Company LTD./C=US' -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem\n\n\nRun with SSL flag\n\n\nhttp-server -S\n\n\n\n\nApplications \nClient-Side + Server-Side\n\n\n(Tutorials \nopenvidu-js-java\n, \nopenvidu-mvc-java\n, \nopenvidu-js-node\n, \nopenvidu-mvc-node\n)\n\n\nJust need to add a new parameter when launching you openvidu-server container:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu/openvidu-server-kms Docker container\n (See \nDockerHub\n): override the default value of the property \nopenvidu.publicurl\n:\n\n\ndocker run -p 4443:4443 --rm -e openvidu.secret=MY_SECRET openvidu/openvidu-server-kms\n\n\n\nin Windows is...\n\n\ndocker run -p 4443:4443 --rm -e openvidu.secret=MY_SECRET -e openvidu.publicurl=https://192.168.99.100:4443/ openvidu/openvidu-server-kms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd let know your app/tutorial how to initialize \nopenvidu-java-client\n or \nopenvidu-node-client\n (or where to send your REST API operations in case you are not using any of these clients). For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJava tutorials\n (tutorials \nopenvidu-js-java\n, \nopenvidu-mvc-java\n): override the default value of the property \nopenvidu.url\n:\n\n\nmvn package exec:java\n\n\n\nin Windows is...\n\n\nmvn -Dopenvidu.url=https://192.168.99.100:4443/ package exec:java\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this change we are simply changing the param \nurlOpenViduServer\n that our OpenVidu object from \nopenvidu-java-client\n will receive in \nits constructor\n. This change is something related to these specific applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode tutorials\n (tutorials \nopenvidu-js-node\n, \nopenvidu-mvc-node\n): change the URL param passed on launch:\n\n\nnode server.js https://localhost:4443/ MY_SECRET\n\n\n\nin Windows is...\n\n\nnode server.js https://192.168.99.100:4443/ MY_SECRET\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this change we are simply changing the param \nurlOpenViduServer\n that our OpenVidu object from \nopenvidu-node-client\n will receive in \nits constructor\n. This change is something related to these specific applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Does my app need a server-side?\n\n\nFirst of all, let's differentiate between OpenVidu server-side and your application's server-side. \n\n\n\n\nYou will always need OpenVidu Server deployed at some place on the Internet (check the \nDeployment section\n to learn how to do it in 5 minutes). For now, OpenVidu doesn't support p2p direct connections between two users, so all the traffic must flow to OpenVidu Server or from OpenVidu Server.\n\n\nYou will generally want your application to have its own server-side. Why?\n\n\n\n\nWell, it is really not necessary. You can have a pure client-side application if you want. Just check any of these tutorials:\nopenvidu-hello-world\n, \nopenvidu-insecure-js\n, \nopenvidu-getaroom\n\n\nThe problem here is pretty evident: if you don't have any kind of server side to control your users, anyone can use your app. In fact, you can respectively see \nhere\n, \nhere\n and \nhere\n a comment warning about this matter in every insecure tutorial. Due to the lack of a server-side in these tutorials, we have no choice but to embed the REST API consumption methods in our JavaScript code, which includes hardcoding our secret in the JS client code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n: Do NOT include your SECRET in your JavaScript or HTML files in a production environment!\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nFirst an OpenVidu app Client-Side Only.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nSecond an OpenVidu app Client-Side + Server-Side.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nIn production you will usually want the second option to avoid unwanted users.\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. The CloudFormation Stack is a nice option for Amazon, but I don't like it. I want more control\n\n\nYou can always deploy everything by yourself. To do so, check \nDeploying OpenVidu as a native service\n section. It is very important to understand all the posibilities you have available regarding to the architecture of your system: you can have everything running in the same host or split the services between two or even more machines. That's up to you.\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nApp, OpenVidu Server and KMS run in the same machine\n\n      \nApp runs in its own machine. OpenVidu Server and KMS run in the same machine\n\n      \nApp, OpenVidu Server and KMS all run in different machines\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn this diagram \nSTUN/TURN server\n is not outlined. It is another necessary service, and it can be hosted wherever you want (we recommend running it in the same host as Kurento Media Server).\n\n\n\n\n6. What are STUN and TURN servers and why do I need them?\n\n\nIf the user's devices don't have a public and reachable IP, WebRTC connections cannot be established and therefore, video streams cannot be sent or received. This occurs when the users are behind NAT's and Firewalls. In brief, when they are hidden under complex networks.\n\n\nIn order to support these circumstances, WebRTC relies on \nSTUN and TURN\n servers:\n\n\n\n\nSTUN\n can easily provide to the user's devices their own public IP (the IP that other devices on the Internet use to connect to it), so they can tell OpenVidu where to send the video streams. Only with a STUN server, around \n86%\n of the time the connection will be successful.\n\n\nTURN\n is an extension of STUN, and covers the most extreme cases of complex networks (symmetric NATs). It acts as a gateway, passing all the media streams form one side to the other. This situation will occur with a probability of around \n8%\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor all purposes, OpenVidu Server acts as a final user, and your connections may fail if it is hosted behind a complex network. To provide a a solid service you definitely need both STUN and TURN servers. There are many public, free-to-use STUN servers (\nSTUN server list\n), but because TURN always faces a much larger load when coming into play, no one offers it free of charge. The good news is that it is very easy to install a COTURN server, which offers both STUN and TURN:\n\n\n\n\nOur ready-to-use \nCloudFormation stack\n already includes a properly configured COTURN server.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are deploying OpenVidu Server by your own, there are detailed instructions in the \nDeploying OpenVidu as a native service\n section, which explains how to install, configure and run COTURN in Ubuntu.\n\n\n\n\nYou can test your \nCOTURN\n server on this website: \nTrickle ICE\n. To do so, remove the default Google server from the list and add your own following this format: \nturn:YOUR_TURN_IP:YOUR_TURN_PORT\n (add your TURN username and password below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. What does OpenVidu not integrate regarding WebRTC and Kurento yet?\n\n\nAs the main goal OpenVidu has is to make as simple as possible the integration of video-call capabilities in applications, it would make little sense to support all the features provided by Kurento: why would most of developers want visual recognition or augmented reality capabilities when adding video-calls to their apps?\n\n\nBut there's also a bunch of features supported by Kurento or WebRTC that will be part of OpenVidu as well:\n\n\n\n\nVideo composing\n: right now OpenVidu streams are always sent and received without any processing in Kurento Media Server, so every subscription to a video stream in a video-session implies its own WebRTC connection. We intend to provide the possibility of configuring video-sessions to be processed and send as only one video, composed in a grid by all the published streams.\n\n\nDirect p2p connections between users\n: OpenVidu will offer the possibility of connecting users without having to use Kurento Media Server as central node. This can be very advantegeous for certain use-cases, as will reduce the need of infraestructure.\n\n\nSingle stream video recording\n: OpenVidu will support single stream recording, not only composed recording.\n\n\nMobile platforms\n: OpenVidu will provide clients for both Android and iOS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Does OpenVidu support Android and iOS?\n\n\nAt the moment there are no OpenVidu clients for mobile platforms, but we are working on it. In the future you will have available \nOpenVidu Android\n and \nOpenVidu iOS\n, joining \nOpenVidu Browser\n. The main goal here is that all of them are fully compatible with one another.\n\n\n\n\n9. Which is the current status of OpenVidu on scalability and fault tolerance?\n\n\nThis particular point relies on Kurento Media Server performance, as it is the media server used by OpenVidu. \nTestRTC\n published on September 13, 2017 a very interesting article describing in detail the behavior of Kurento Media Server while holding a different number of video-sessions. \nHere\n is the complete article.\n\n\nThese are the conclusions for a machine with \n8 cores and 15 GB of RAM\n. The upper limit where the following scenarios guaranteed good quality of service are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario\n\n\nSize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1:1 video calls\n\n\n18 users in 9 parallel sessions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4-way group video calls (grid composing)\n\n\n3 rooms of 4 users each\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1:N broadcast\n\n\n1 broadcaster + 80-150 viewers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, one of the most important features OpenVidu will offer is the possibility of automated scalability and fault tolerance. We intend to provide an easy-to-use service integrated with Amazon Web Services to allow the automated launching and shutdown of servers depending on the workload of your application.\n\n\n\n\n10. I am getting an \"Error accesing the camera\" and I have already granted permissions on the browser\n\n\nIf you are using \nChrome\n: you \ncannot access the camera or microphone from a \nhttp\n URL if it is not \nlocalhost\n or \n127.0.0.1\n. In a nutshell: in Chrome accessing the webcam on \nhttp://localhost:8080\n or \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8080\n is perfectly OK. But, for example, on \nhttp://172.17.0.1:8080\n it will through an error saying \"\nOnly secure origins are allowed\n\". If for any reason you want to serve your app locally on a custom URL, the only solution is to serve it over \nhttps\n with a certificate. If you are making use of the web server we have strongly suggested over the documentation (\nnpm install -g http-server\n), you can do this with the following commands on your application's root path:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a selfsigned certificate with \nopenssl\n\n\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -subj '/CN=www.mydom.com/O=My Company LTD./C=US' -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \nhttp-server\n with SSL flag\n\n\nhttp-server -S",

This means logs about OpenVidu objects being created and destroyed and logs for each triggered event (only for those you are subscribed to).\n     \n     \n     \n      Warn and Error messages are specifically reserved for unwanted situations, and you should check your code in case you spot one of them.\n     \n     \n     \n      If you enable the lowest level of logging you can see all the messages concerning the WebRTC negotiation process (generally not very interesting for an OpenVidu user).",

This can be very helpful, as you can test with different devices and browsers at the same time. To achieve this, you can use  Ngrok . The set up for Ubuntu is quite simple:   Download  Ngrok  with this link [ LINK ] and unzip it.  Download this  Ngrok  configuration file (named  ngrok.yml ) from our GitHub repo  [ LINK ]  and place it in the same path as  Ngrok  binary.  Run  Ngrok  with this command:  ./ngrok start --all -config=ngrok.yml . You will get two public IPs (ended with  .ngrok.io ) publishing your local address  localhost:5000  and  localhost:3000 .  You just have to run you app at port  3000  and run OpenVidu Server locally adding this parameter:  When running OpenVidu Server as a Docker container:  -e spring.profiles.active=ngrok  When running OpenVidu Server as a JAR:  -Dspring.profiles.active=ngrok    That's it! Now you can connect to your app through the  Ngrok  public IP and the connection to OpenVidu Server will work just fine. You have \"deployed\" your app on your own computer, and cross-device testing through your own network is now possible. Connecting to your app over the Internet is also possible, but the video transmission may not work (check  this FAQ  to learn why).",

This occurs when the users are behind NAT's and Firewalls. In brief, when they are hidden under complex networks.  In order to support these circumstances, WebRTC relies on  STUN and TURN  servers:   STUN  can easily provide to the user's devices their own public IP (the IP that other devices on the Internet use to connect to it), so they can tell OpenVidu where to send the video streams. Only with a STUN server, around  86%  of the time the connection will be successful.  TURN  is an extension of STUN, and covers the most extreme cases of complex networks (symmetric NATs). It acts as a gateway, passing all the media streams form one side to the other. This situation will occur with a probability of around  8% .   For all purposes, OpenVidu Server acts as a final user, and your connections may fail if it is hosted behind a complex network. To provide a a solid service you definitely need both STUN and TURN servers. There are many public, free-to-use STUN servers ( STUN server list ), but because TURN always faces a much larger load when coming into play, no one offers it free of charge. The good news is that it is very easy to install a COTURN server, which offers both STUN and TURN:   Our ready-to-use  CloudFormation stack  already includes a properly configured COTURN server.   If you are deploying OpenVidu Server by your own, there are detailed instructions in the  Deploying OpenVidu as a native service  section, which explains how to install, configure and run COTURN in Ubuntu.

You can just clone and use our sample application as a starting point or maybe you want to add OpenVidu to your existing Ionic app. \nHere you have\n the necessary configuration steps to do so (basically Android permissions stuff).\n\n\nWe are currently working on making OpenVidu work on iOS with Ionic.\n\n\n\n\nNew types of filters supported\n\n\nOpenVidu 2.5.0 brought a fantastic and a differentiating element: \nreal time audio and video filters\n. Now we have extended this capability to support new GStreamer based filters such as \ntextoverlay\n, \ntimeoverlay\n or \nclockoverlay\n.\n\n\nYou can embed any text, the timestamp of the video or the current time, easily customizing its position and format. Check these filters in \nGStreamer section\n of filters documentation.\n\n\n\n\nRecording service now generates a thumbnail when stopping the recording\n\n\nWhenever you stop the recording of a session, OpenVidu will automatically generate a thumbnail for the video, getting it from the middle of the video timeline. You can access it from\u00a0\nhttps://OPENVIDU_SERVER_IP:4443/recordings/RECORDING_NAME.jpg\n\n\nDo not worry about their lifecycle: they are linked to the video file itself. If you decide to delete the recording, thumbnail will also be deleted.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n\n\n\nImportant fix for increasing success rate in establishing media connections\n\n\nTime ago we ran into a pretty ugly bug that was causing some problems during WebRTC negotiation, resulting in some clients located in complex networks (like a company's WiFi network) not being able to connect to OpenVidu Server. What developers perceived was that in certain scenarios some users simply couldn't receive or send any media connection.\n\n\nThis bug has been completely solved in OpenVidu 2.6.0. Now media connections will work fine in almost every client network configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.0\n\n\nArtifacts\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nArtifact\n\n    \nType\n\n    \nCompatible Version\n\n    \nLink\n\n    \nInfo\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-browser\n\n    \nNPM package\n\n    \n2.5.0\n\n    \nNPM\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nJS file\n\n    \n2.5.0\n\n    \nGitHub\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-server\n\n    \nJAR\n\n    \n2.5.0\n\n    \nGitHub\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nDocker container\n\n    \n2.5.0\n\n    \nDockerHub\n\n  \n\n    \n\n    \nDocker container (+KMS)\n\n    \n2.5.0\n\n    \nDockerHub\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-java-client\n\n    \nMVN package\n\n    \n2.5.0\n\n    \nMVN Repository\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-node-client\n\n    \nNPM package\n\n    \n2.5.0\n\n    \nNPM\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-webcomponent\n\n    \nZIP\n\n    \n2.5.0\n\n    \nGitHub\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-angular\n\n    \nNPM package\n\n    \n2.5.0\n\n    \nNPM\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-react\n\n    \nNPM package\n\n    \n2.5.0\n\n    \nNPM\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n\n\n\nKurento filters support\n\n\nOpenVidu API offers a simple way of applying filters to video and audio streams in the server side by making use of Kurento Media Server capabilities.

Now it is possible to specifically configure certain input and output bandwidth for every user connected to a session. This way you can customize the bandwidth for each Publisher and Subscriber object of each Connection object. Users with no specific configuration will use the global values.\n\n\nYou can set custom bandwidths by using \nREST API\n, \nopenvidu-java-client\n or \nopenvidu-node-client\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREST API\n: in \nPOST /api/tokens\n append a property in the json body like this\n\n\n\"kurentoOptions\": {\n  \"videoMaxRecvBandwidth\": 1000,\n  \"videoMinRecvBandwidth\": 1000,\n  \"videoMaxSendBandwidth\": 1000,\n  \"videoMinSendBandwidth\": 1000\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-java-client\n: build your tokens like this\n\n\nKurentoOptions kurentoOptions = new KurentoOptions.Builder()\n  .videoMaxRecvBandwidth(1000)\n  .videoMinRecvBandwidth(1000)\n  .videoMaxSendBandwidth(1000)\n  .videoMinSendBandwidth(1000)\n  .build();\nTokenOptions tokenOptions = new TokenOptions.Builder()\n  .data(\"User data\")\n  .role(OpenViduRole.PUBLISHER)\n  .kurentoOptions(kurentoOptions)\n  .build();\nString myToken = mySession.generateToken(tokenOptions);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-node-client\n: build your tokens like this\n\n\nvar tokenOptions = {\n    data: \"User data\",\n    role: OpenViduRole.PUBLISHER,\n    kurentoOptions: {\n      videoMaxRecvBandwidth: 1000,\n      videoMinRecvBandwidth: 1000,\n      videoMaxSendBandwidth: 1000,\n      videoMinSendBandwidth: 1000\n    }\n};\nmySession.generateToken(tokenOptions).then(token =\n { ... } );\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREST API and Server SDKs improvements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnection\n objects have a brand new property very useful for session analysis: \nplatform\n.

For example: \n\"Chrome 69.0.3497.81 on OS X 10.13.6 64-bit\"\n or \n\"Firefox Mobile 62.0 on Mobile (Android 8.1.0)\"\n\n\nYou can get this information by retrieving session information with the REST api (\nGET /api/sessions\n or \nGET /api/sessions/SESSION_ID\n) or inspecting \nopenvidu-java-client\n and \nopenvidu-node-client\n Session objects: calling \nSession.fetch()\n or \nOpenVidu.fetch()\n will update the status of their \nactiveConnections\n property. Then you can check it out in \nopenvidu-node-client\n (property \nSession.activeConnections\n) or \nopenvidu-java-client\n (method \nSession.getActiveConnections()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession\n, \nConnection\n and \nPublisher\n objects now have \ncreatedAt\n property, indicating when these objects where initialized in OpenVidu Server. This property has been integrated to maintain consistency with OpenVidu Server Call Detail Record, which has already been storing it in previous versions (check \n\"timestamp\"\n property of every \nCDR entry\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Browser improvements\n\n\n\n\nNew method \nOpenVidu.checkScreenSharingCapabilities()\n. It allows developers to know if the client platform supports screen sharing (see its declaration in \nOpenVidu Documentation\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew OpenVidu Angular and OpenVidu React libraries\n\n\nWe introduced OpenVidu Web Component in release \n2.3.0\n. Now we offer native libraries for both Angular and React (latest versions) to insert the same powerful component in your applications by making use of each framework capabilities. You can check a tutorial for OpenVidu Angular (\nopenvidu-library-angular\n) and  for OpenVidu React (\nopenvidu-library-react\n) right now.\n\n\nOf course you can keep using OpenVidu Browser library instead of these components in any frontend framework. These tutorials show a basic use of OpenVidu Browser in an Angular app (\nopenvidu-insecure-angular\n) and in a React app (\nopenvidu-insecure-react\n).\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n\n\n\nLocal tracks now are not stopped on stream disposal if property \nPublisherProperties.videoSource\n was of type MediaStreamTrack (custom stream got with \nOpenVidu.getUserMedia()\n). \nIssue \n#107\n, PR \n#108\n\n\nDeprecated \nRTCPeerConnection.getRemoteStreams\n and \nRTCPeerConnection.getLocalStreams\n to \nRTCPeerConnection.getReceivers\n and \nRTCPeerConnection.getSenders\n. \nIssue \n#54\n\n\nAllow full screen sharing in Firefox. \nIssue \n#103\n, PR \n#105\n\n\nFixed duplicated camera permissions in Firefox if \nPublisherProperties.videoSource/audioSource\n are provided as MediaStreamTracks. \nPR \n#109\n\n\nopenvidu-node-client now rejects with Error object upon OpenVidu Server unreachable. \nIssue \n#116\n, PR \n#117\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.0\n\n\nArtifacts\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nArtifact\n\n    \nType\n\n    \nCompatible Version\n\n    \nLink\n\n    \nInfo\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-browser\n\n    \nNPM package\n\n    \n2.4.0\n\n    \nNPM\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nJS file\n\n    \n2.4.0\n\n    \nGitHub\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-server\n\n    \nJAR\n\n    \n2.4.0\n\n    \nGitHub\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nDocker container\n\n    \n2.4.0\n\n    \nDockerHub\n\n  \n\n    \n\n    \nDocker container (+KMS)\n\n    \n2.4.0\n\n    \nDockerHub\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-java-client\n\n    \nMVN package\n\n    \n2.4.0\n\n    \nMVN Repository\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-node-client\n\n    \nNPM package\n\n    \n2.4.0\n\n    \nNPM\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-webcomponent\n\n    \nZIP\n\n    \n2.4.0\n\n    \nGitHub\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Java Client and OpenVidu Node Client REST API support for v2.3.0\n\n\nBackend clients are now compatible with REST API 2.3.0, adding methods:\n\n\n\n\nSession.close()\n: close a Session from your backend\n\n\nSession.forceDisconnect()\n: force some user to leave a Session\n\n\nSession.forceUnpublish()\n: force some user to unpublish a Publisher from a Session\n\n\nSession.fetch()\n: bring Session information from OpenVidu Server\n\n\nOpenVidu.fetch()\n: bring information from every active Session from OpenVidu Server\n\n\n\n\nYou can call methods \nSession.fetch()\n and \nOpenVidu.fetch()\n to bring the current status of sessions from OpenVidu Server.

Of course, if you want to connect users to the same session, the tokens should be generated for the same session.\nAttribute \ntheme\n can be \ndark\n or \nlight\n. Use the one that better fits your application.\n\n\nOpenVidu Web Component supports a reasonable amount of different dimensions, and every video displayed inside of it will be automatically relocated and resized for its optimal position upon window resizing. You can set the position, width and height of the component by styling it like this:\n\n\n\n\nSetting its property \nposition\n to \nabsolute\n or \nfixed\n, depending on your web layout and the desired behavior you want the component to have.\n\n\nPlaying with values:\n\n\nwidth\n\n\nheight\n\n\ntop\n or \nbottom\n\n\nright\n or \nleft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the following CSS rule would position the upper OpenVidu Web Component in the bottom-right corner of your web, taking up half of the height of the page and a third of its width.\n\n\nopenvidu-webcomponent {\n  position: absolute;\n  bottom: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  width: 33vw;\n  height: 50vh;\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you give enough width to the component (at least \n700px\n), users can communicate through an integrated chat.\n\n\n\n\nTo see some images of OpenVidu Web Component in action, check this post on \nMedium\n. If you want to learn more about OpenVidu Web Component, visit \nTutorials section\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n\n\n\nStreamPropertyChangedEvent (See \nhere\n)\n\n\nOpenVidu Browser now lets users connected to a Session know when any Stream they are subscribed to undergoes any possible change in its properties. Every Session object will dispatch this new event (you can subscribe to it to every Publisher or Subscriber object too). This event can refer to the following Stream properties:\n\n\n\n\nStream.audioActive\n: this property may change if the user publishing the Stream calls \nPublisher.pusblishAudio(bool)\n.\n\n\nStream.videoActive\n: this property may change if the user publishing the Stream calls \nPublisher.publishVideo(bool)\n.\n\n\nStream.videoDimensions\n: this property may change if...\n\n\n...the user publishing the stream is screen-sharing and the shared window changes its dimensions.\n\n\n...the user is publishing from a mobile device and it is rotated (every camera from a phone will invert the resolution in the output video when rotated).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, for example, now you can do:\n\n\nvar OV = new OpenVidu();\nvar session = OV.initSession();\nsession.on('streamPropertyChanged', event =\n {\n    if (event.changedProperty === 'audioActive') {\n        console.log('The state of the audio of the publisher has changed. Is enabled? -\n ' + event.newValue);\n    } else if (event.changedProperty === 'videoActive') {\n        console.log('The state of the video of the publisher has changed. Is enabled? -\n ' + event.newValue);\n    } else if (event.changedProperty === 'videoDimensions') {\n        console.log('The video dimensions of the publisher has changed. New dimensions: ' + event.newValue);\n    }\n});\n\n\n\n\nThis way you can react more easily upon this variations in the published streams and update your application's layout accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nSession.capabilities (See \nhere\n)\n\n\nYou can check capabilities property of Session object to know which methods are able to invoke each one of your clients, depending on their role. Also, if a client tries to call a method for which he has no permissions, now an OpenViduError is thrown with property \nname\n being \nOPENVIDU_PERMISSION_DENIED\n.\n\n\n\n\nNew MODERATOR role\n\n\nAt last developers have available the new role that has been in our roadmap for a long time. Users connecting to a session with a token configured with MODERATOR role can call every method granted for SUBSCRIBER and PUBLISHER roles, but also:\n\n\n\n\nSession.forceDisconnect\n: you can evict any user from the Session (force the method \nSession.disconnect\n)\n\n\nSession.forceUnpublish\n: you can stop the Publisher of any user publishing in the Session (force the method \nSession.unpublish\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREST API extended\n\n\n5 new methods join the \nREST API of OpenVidu Server\n:\n\n\n\n\nRetrieve active session info: \nGET /api/sessions/\nSESSION_ID\n\n\nRetrieve all active sessions info: \nGET /api/sessions\n\n\nClose a session: \nDELETE /api/sessions/\nSESSION_ID\n\n\nForce the disconnection of a user from a session: \nDELETE /api/sessions/\nSESSION_ID\n/connection/\nCONNECTION_ID\n\n\nForce the unpublishing of a user's stream from a session: \nDELETE /api/sessions/\nSESSION_ID\n/stream/\nSTREAM_ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture iterations will add this capabilities to \nopenvidu-java-client\n and \nopenvidu-node-client\n libraries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure global bandwidth for your WebRTC connections\n\n\nWe have included a first way to set the maximum and minimum bandwidths for the media connections established between browsers and OpenVidu Server. You can configure it with the following system properties, as stated in \nOpenVidu Server configuration\n sections:\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu.streams.video.max-recv-bandwidth\n: Maximum video bandwidth sent from clients to OpenVidu Server, in kbps. 0 means unconstrained (default 1000)\n\n\nopenvidu.streams.video.min-recv-bandwidth\n: Minimum video bandwidth sent from clients to OpenVidu Server, in kbps. 0 means unconstrained (default 300)\n\n\nopenvidu.streams.video.max-send-bandwidth\n: Maximum video bandwidth sent from OpenVidu Server to clients, in kbps. 0 means unconstrained (default 1000)\n\n\nopenvidu.streams.video.min-send-bandwidth\n: Minimum video bandwidth sent from OpenVidu Server to clients, in kbps. 0 means unconstrained (default 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture iterations will study the possibility of configuring this same parameters for each session individually or even for each incoming or outgoing WebRTC connection (maybe as part of \nPublisherProperties\n or \nSubscriberProperties\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.0\n\n\nArtifacts\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nArtifact\n\n    \nType\n\n    \nCompatible Version\n\n    \nLink\n\n    \nInfo\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-browser\n\n    \nNPM package\n\n    \n2.2.0\n\n    \nNPM\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nJS file\n\n    \n2.2.0\n\n    \nGitHub\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-server\n\n    \nJAR\n\n    \n2.2.0\n\n    \nGitHub\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nDocker container\n\n    \n2.2.0\n\n    \nDockerHub\n\n  \n\n    \n\n    \nDocker container (+KMS)\n\n    \n2.2.0\n\n    \nDockerHub\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-java-client\n\n    \nMVN package\n\n    \n2.2.0\n\n    \nMVN Repository\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-node-client\n\n    \nNPM package\n\n    \n2.2.0\n\n    \nNPM\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu now offers \nintegrated and automated support for TURN server\n. We encourage developers to check out our \npost on Medium\n to learn more about it.\n\n\nThe platform now integrates by default a COTURN server as part of its ecosystem. This means that media connections will work OK even when clients are located on restricted networks. When \ndeploying OpenVidu Server in Amazon Web Services\n with our Cloud Formation template no changes are required at all. If you are deploying OpenVidu Server on your own in an Ubuntu machine, installation instructions have changed a little bit.

This allows us to let OpenVidu take control of the video elements (even if our framework dynamically creates them) and do not worry about its internals. This is all explained in detail in \nManage video players\n section.\n\n\nIf you want to check out a real example of this behavior, explore our renovated \nOpenVidu Angular tutorial\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0.0\n\n\nArtifacts\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nArtifact\n\n    \nType\n\n    \nCompatible Version\n\n    \nLink\n\n    \nInfo\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-browser\n\n    \nNPM package\n\n    \n2.0.0\n\n    \nNPM\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nJS file\n\n    \n2.0.0\n\n    \nGitHub\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-server\n\n    \nJAR\n\n    \n2.0.0\n\n    \nGitHub\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nDocker container\n\n    \n2.0.0\n\n    \nDockerHub\n\n  \n\n    \n\n    \nDocker container (+KMS)\n\n    \n2.0.0\n\n    \nDockerHub\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-java-client\n\n    \nMVN package\n\n    \n2.0.0\n\n    \nMVN Repository\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-node-client\n\n    \nNPM package\n\n    \n2.0.0\n\n    \nNPM\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first breaking change update for OpenVidu, which brings in lots of new features and internal improvements.\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Browser new methods\n\n\n\n\nSession.publish()\n: now returns a Promise so you can tell if the method was successful or not.\n\n\nSession.signal()\n: now returns a Promise so you can tell if the method was successful or not.\n\n\nSubcriber.subscribeToAudio()\n and \nSubscriber.subscribeToVideo()\n: new methods that allows you to mute the audio or video tracks of a remote stream.\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu.initPublisher()\n: now expects properties as interface \nPublisherProperties\n. They include:\n\n\n{\n    audioSource: undefined, // The source of audio. If undefined default audio input\n    videoSource: undefined, // The source of video. If undefined default video input\n    publishAudio: true,     // Whether you want to start publishing with your audio unmuted or muted\n    publishVideo: true,     // Whether you want to start publishing with your video enabled or not\n    resolution: '640x480',  // The resolution of your video\n    frameRate: 30,          // The frame rate of your video\n    insertMode: 'APPEND',   // How the video will be inserted in the target element\n    mirror: false           // Whether to mirror your local video or not\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession.subscribe()\n: now expects properties as interface \nSubscriberProperties\n.

Just set these variables to the property \ndeviceId\n of any of the devices returned by this method.\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu.getUserMedia()\n: method improved. Now devs can customize a MediaStream object before calling \nOpenVidu.initPublisher()\n method, setting property \naudioSource\n or \nvideoSource\n to a MediaStreamTrack object (see \ndocs\n for further information)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Browser new properties\n\n\n\n\nStream.frameRate\n: new property defining the frame rate of video streams. This property will only have value if the Publisher owning the stream has set property \nframeRate\n of \nPublisherProperties\n when calling \nOpenVidu.initPublisher()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Browser events\n\n\n\n\nNew events \naccessDialogOpened\n and \naccessDialogClosed\n: dispatched by Publisher objects when the browser asks the user to grant permissions to camera or michrophone by opening a pop-up. You can use them to warn your users about it.\n\n\nNew events \nrecordingStarted\n and \nrecordingStopped\n: dispatched by Session object when the recording of a Session starts and stops. You can customize which clients will receive this event thanks to new property \nopenvidu.recording.notification\n (see \nOpenVidu Server configuration\n)\n\n\nEvents \npublisherStartSpeaking\n and \npublisherStopSpeaking\n improved: more customizable thanks to \nOpenVidu.setAdvancedConfiguration()\n and better overall performance.\n\n\nEvents \nstreamDestroyed\n, \nconnectionDestroyed\n and \nsessionDisconnected\n have new property \nreason\n. This gives more information about why the events have been dispatched so you can take specific actions depending on the context: maybe a stream has been destroyed because the user publishing has deliberately diposed it or maybe the network connection has unexpectedly closed (see docs for \nStreamEvent\n, \nConnectionEvent\n and \nSessionDisconnectedEvent\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther improvements in OpenVidu Browser\n\n\n\n\nSupport for \ncustom screen sharing extensions for Chrome\n\n\nSupport for custom STUN and TURN servers in openvidu-browser. Use \nOpenVidu.setAdvancedConfiguration()\n\n\nLibrary size decreased in almost 30% (\nopenvidu-browser.min.js\n from 300 KB to 216 KB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Server new features\n\n\n\n\nNew property \nname\n for recordings: you can now specify which name should OpenVidu Server give to each one of your recording files. You can do it by using the \nREST API\n (by setting \nbody parameter \"name\" in POST /api/recordings/start\n), \nopenvidu-java-client\n (by using \nRecordingProperties.Builder.name()\n) or \nopenvidu-node-client\n (by setting property \nRecordingProperties.name\n)\n\n\nNow support for initializing sessions with a custom \nsessionId\n. You can take advantage of this new property to facilitate the mapping between OpenVidu Server 'session' entities and your own 'session' entities. You can set it by using the \nREST API\n (by setting \nbody parameter \"customSessionId\" in POST /api/sessions\n), \nopenvidu-java-client\n (by using \nSessionProperties.Builder.customSessionId()\n) or \nopenvidu-node-client\n (by setting property \nSessionProperties.customSessionId\n)\n\n\nCall Detail Record extended: new events \nrecordingStarted\n and \nrecordingStopped\n, property \nreason\n for events \nsessionDestroyed\n, \nparticipantLeft\n and \nwebrtcConnectionDestroyed\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n\n\n\nNow when any participant unexpectedly disconnects from a session (for example, due to a network failure), \nconnectionDestroyed\n event is sent to the rest of participants with property \nreason\n set to \nnetworkDisconnect\n.\n\n\nWhen OpenVidu Server is stopped, it will try to gracefully finish every in progress session and recording. This way no recording file will end corrupted upon OpenVidu Server termination (this cannot be granted if the process crashes or is forcibly terminated)\n\n\nNow both STUN and TURN \nOpenVidu Server configuration parameters\n can be set up at the same time with no overwritings.\n\n\nTons of small fixes and code refactoring that makes OpenVidu more stable and easy to test and develop\n\n\n\n\nBREAKING CHANGES LIST\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Browser\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu.initSession\n now doesn't receive any input parameter.\n\n\nOpenVidu.initPublisher\n input parameters have changed. Now \nproperties\n parameter must match \nPublisherProperties\n interface.\n\n\nSession.connect\n method has been promisified. Change the last mandatory \ncallback\n parameter for a Promise implementation: \nsession.connect(token, (error) =\n { ... })\n to \nsession.connect(token).then(() =\n {...}).catch(error =\n {...});\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Java Client\n\n\n\n\nAll \nArchive\n entities are now called \nRecording\n. This includes: class \nArchive\n to \nRecording\n, class \nArchiveMode\n to \nRecordingMode\n, class \nArchiveLayout\n to \nRecordingLayout\n, method \nSessionProperties.archiveLayout()\n to \nSessionProperties.recordingLayout()\n, method \nSessionProperties.archiveMode()\n to \nSessionProperties.recordingMode()\n, method \nSessionProperties.Builder.archiveLayout()\n to \nSessionProperties.Builder.recordingLayout()\n, method \nSessionProperties.Builder.archiveMode()\n to \nSessionProperties.Builder.recordingMode()\n\n\nRecordingLayout\n property in \nSessionProperties.Builder\n is now configured calling method \ndefaultRecordingLayout()\n instead of \nrecordingLayout()\n. This means that if one Session is gonna be recorded more than once, each recording layout may be customize with \nRecordingProperties.Builder.recordingLayout()\n, which will overwrite the default one globally configured in SessionProperties object. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Node Client\n\n\n\n\nWe have removed the builder pattern in all openvidu-node-client classes. Now objects are used instead, which includes classes \nTokenOptions\n, \nSessionProperties\n and \nRecordingProperties\n. For example, instead of getting a TokenOptions object like this: \nvar tokenOptions = new TokenOptions.Builder().data(serverData).role(role).build()\n now it must be like this: \nvar tokenOptions = {data: serverData, role: role}\n\n\nThere has been a simple change in certain asynchronous call. Method \nSession.getSessionId()\n is now synchronous, but method \nOpenVidu.createSession()\n is now asynchronous (the reason is pretty simple: now method \ncreateSession\n implements the behavior that \ngetSessionId\n was providing the first time it was called for certain \nSession\n object).\n\n\nAll callback methods have been promisified. This includes method \nSession.generateToken(tokenOptions?, callback): void\n (now  \nSession.generateToken(tokenOptions?): Promise\nstring\n) and method \nSession.getSessionId(callback): void\n (now \nOpenVidu.createSession(): Promise\nSession\n, take also into account that the async call has changed from one method to the other as stated in the previous point).\n\n\nAll \nArchive\n entities are now called \nRecording\n. This includes: object \nArchive\n to \nRecording\n, object \nArchiveMode\n to \nRecordingMode\n, object \nArchiveLayout\n to \nRecordingLayout\n, method \nSessionProperties.archiveLayout()\n to \nSessionProperties.recordingLayout()\n, method \nSessionProperties.archiveMode()\n to \nSessionProperties.recordingMode()\n, method \nSessionProperties.Builder.archiveLayout()\n to \nSessionProperties.Builder.recordingLayout()\n, method \nSessionProperties.Builder.archiveMode()\n to \nSessionProperties.Builder.recordingMode()\n\n\nrecordingLayout\n property in \nSessionProperties\n has changed to \ndefaultRecordingLayout\n. This means that if one Session is gonna be recorded more than once, each recording layout may be customize with \nrecordingLayout\n property (of \nRecordingProperties\n interface, which will overwrite the default one globally configured in SessionProperties object. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREST API\n\n\n\n\nAll \nArchive\n entities are now called \nRecording\n in API REST. For example: \n{\"archiveMode\": \"ARCHIVE_MODE\", \"archiveLayout\": \"ARCHIVE_LAYOUT\", \"mediaMode\": \"MEDIA_MODE\"}\n now is \n{\"recordingMode\": \"RECORDING_MODE\", \"recordingLayout\": \"RECORDING_LAYOUT\", \"mediaMode\": \"MEDIA_MODE\"}\n.\n\n\nField \nrecordingLayout\n is now called \ndefaultRecordingLayout\n in operation \nPOST /api/sessions\n. This means that if one Session is gonna be recorded more than once, each recording layout may be customize adding a new field \nrecordingLayout\n in the call to \nPOST /api/recordings/start\n of the API REST, which will overwrite the default one globally configured during \nPOST /api/sessions\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther breaking changes\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Server default port from \n8443\n to \n4443\n\n\nOpenVidu Server configuration property \nopenvidu.recording.free-access\n is now \nopenvidu.recording.public-access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.9.0-beta-1\n\n\nArtifacts\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nArtifact\n\n    \nType\n\n    \nCompatible version\n\n    \nLink\n\n    \nInfo\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-browser\n\n    \nNPM package\n\n    \n1.9.0-beta-1\n\n    \nNPM\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nJS file\n\n    \n1.9.0-beta-1\n\n    \nGitHub\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-server\n\n    \nJAR\n\n    \n1.9.0-beta-1\n\n    \nGitHub\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nDocker container\n\n    \n1.9.0-beta-1\n\n    \nDockerHub\n\n  \n\n    \n\n    \nDocker container (+KMS)\n\n    \n1.9.0-beta-1\n\n    \nDockerHub\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-java-client\n\n    \nMVN package\n\n    \n1.8.0\n\n    \nMVN Repository\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nopenvidu-node-client\n\n    \nNPM package\n\n    \n1.8.0\n\n    \nNPM\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafari support\n: now OpenVidu is compatible with the most recent versions of Safari in Mac and iOS.

Of course, if you want to connect users to the same session, the tokens should be generated for the same session.\nAttribute  theme  can be  dark  or  light . Use the one that better fits your application.  OpenVidu Web Component supports a reasonable amount of different dimensions, and every video displayed inside of it will be automatically relocated and resized for its optimal position upon window resizing. You can set the position, width and height of the component by styling it like this:   Setting its property  position  to  absolute  or  fixed , depending on your web layout and the desired behavior you want the component to have.  Playing with values:  width  height  top  or  bottom  right  or  left     For example, the following CSS rule would position the upper OpenVidu Web Component in the bottom-right corner of your web, taking up half of the height of the page and a third of its width.  openvidu-webcomponent {\n  position: absolute;\n  bottom: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  width: 33vw;\n  height: 50vh;\n}  If you give enough width to the component (at least  700px ), users can communicate through an integrated chat.

            "text": "OpenVidu Browser   OpenVidu.initSession  now doesn't receive any input parameter.  OpenVidu.initPublisher  input parameters have changed. Now  properties  parameter must match  PublisherProperties  interface.  Session.connect  method has been promisified. Change the last mandatory  callback  parameter for a Promise implementation:  session.connect(token, (error) =  { ... })  to  session.connect(token).then(() =  {...}).catch(error =  {...});       OpenVidu Java Client   All  Archive  entities are now called  Recording . This includes: class  Archive  to  Recording , class  ArchiveMode  to  RecordingMode , class  ArchiveLayout  to  RecordingLayout , method  SessionProperties.archiveLayout()  to  SessionProperties.recordingLayout() , method  SessionProperties.archiveMode()  to  SessionProperties.recordingMode() , method  SessionProperties.Builder.archiveLayout()  to  SessionProperties.Builder.recordingLayout() , method  SessionProperties.Builder.archiveMode()  to  SessionProperties.Builder.recordingMode()  RecordingLayout  property in  SessionProperties.Builder  is now configured calling method  defaultRecordingLayout()  instead of  recordingLayout() . This means that if one Session is gonna be recorded more than once, each recording layout may be customize with  RecordingProperties.Builder.recordingLayout() , which will overwrite the default one globally configured in SessionProperties object.      OpenVidu Node Client   We have removed the builder pattern in all openvidu-node-client classes. Now objects are used instead, which includes classes  TokenOptions ,  SessionProperties  and  RecordingProperties . For example, instead of getting a TokenOptions object like this:  var tokenOptions = new TokenOptions.Builder().data(serverData).role(role).build()  now it must be like this:  var tokenOptions = {data: serverData, role: role}  There has been a simple change in certain asynchronous call. Method  Session.getSessionId()  is now synchronous, but method  OpenVidu.createSession()  is now asynchronous (the reason is pretty simple: now method  createSession  implements the behavior that  getSessionId  was providing the first time it was called for certain  Session  object).  All callback methods have been promisified. This includes method  Session.generateToken(tokenOptions?, callback): void  (now   Session.generateToken(tokenOptions?): Promise string ) and method  Session.getSessionId(callback): void  (now  OpenVidu.createSession(): Promise Session , take also into account that the async call has changed from one method to the other as stated in the previous point).  All  Archive  entities are now called  Recording . This includes: object  Archive  to  Recording , object  ArchiveMode  to  RecordingMode , object  ArchiveLayout  to  RecordingLayout , method  SessionProperties.archiveLayout()  to  SessionProperties.recordingLayout() , method  SessionProperties.archiveMode()  to  SessionProperties.recordingMode() , method  SessionProperties.Builder.archiveLayout()  to  SessionProperties.Builder.recordingLayout() , method  SessionProperties.Builder.archiveMode()  to  SessionProperties.Builder.recordingMode()  recordingLayout  property in  SessionProperties  has changed to  defaultRecordingLayout . This means that if one Session is gonna be recorded more than once, each recording layout may be customize with  recordingLayout  property (of  RecordingProperties  interface, which will overwrite the default one globally configured in SessionProperties object.      REST API   All  Archive  entities are now called  Recording  in API REST. For example:  {\"archiveMode\": \"ARCHIVE_MODE\", \"archiveLayout\": \"ARCHIVE_LAYOUT\", \"mediaMode\": \"MEDIA_MODE\"}  now is  {\"recordingMode\": \"RECORDING_MODE\", \"recordingLayout\": \"RECORDING_LAYOUT\", \"mediaMode\": \"MEDIA_MODE\"} .  Field  recordingLayout  is now called  defaultRecordingLayout  in operation  POST /api/sessions . This means that if one Session is gonna be recorded more than once, each recording layout may be customize adding a new field  recordingLayout  in the call to  POST /api/recordings/start  of the API REST, which will overwrite the default one globally configured during  POST /api/sessions       Other breaking changes   OpenVidu Server default port from  8443  to  4443  OpenVidu Server configuration property  openvidu.recording.free-access  is now  openvidu.recording.public-access",
