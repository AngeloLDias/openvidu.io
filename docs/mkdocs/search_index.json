            "text": "What is OpenVidu?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu is a platform to facilitate the addition of video calls in your web or mobile \napplication, either group or one-to-one calls. In fact, any combination you come up with is easy to implement with OpenVidu.\n\n\nOpenVidu is licensed under \nApache License v2\n.\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nOpenVidu has been released under \n1.0.0-beta\n (check the \nGitHub release\n). This means that some bugs may appear while working to provide a stable release version as soon as possible.\nYou can make use of the \nMailing List\n or the \nIssue Tracker repository\n to warn about unknown bugs and to clear up any doubts.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can I do with OpenVidu?\n\n\nYou can add video-call functionalities to your app, among many other things. The process is really simple: OpenVidu offers all the necessary services and tools. You just need to integrate them in your app to start enjoying its benefits: one-to-one calls, one-to-many calls, many-to-many calls. Decide which user can publish and which can't. Mute audio or video whenever you want.\n\n\nSo, what about adding a video-call center for attending your customers face to face? Or maybe you are developing an application to hold meetings via videoconference. Or you are thinking about a teacher streaming to all his students within online lessons. The possibilities are endless.\n\n\nYou can check our \nDemos\n to get an idea of what you can do with OpenVidu. Here are some cool pictures of them:\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Architecture\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu is divided into two parts:\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Browser\n: it is a library to use in your client side (available for JavaScript and TypeScript). It allows you to create video-calls, join users to them, send and receive video and audio, etc... All the actions available with OpenVidu are managed via OpenVidu Browser.\n\n\nOpenVidu Server\n: it is an application that handles the server-side stuff. It receives the operations from OpenVidu Browser and do whatever is necessary to establish and manage your video-calls. You will never have to explicitly use it: just to run it and know its IP address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet started\n\n\nThese are the recommended steps for getting started with OpenVidu:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best way to get your first app working in a few minutes is following our \nOpenVidu Hello Word Tutorial\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, you can try any of our \nClient-Side-Only\n tutorials, or maybe go straight to step 3 if you think that you already handle OpenVidu reasonably well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry now any of our \nClient-Side + Server-Side\n tutorials, where you can see how a complete web application works with OpenVidu. Choose your preferred framework, since all 4 applications are exactly the same regarding their look and functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally you can \ndeploy your first app\n and see it working in the real world. You can follow our tutorial, where you can deploy our Demos in your own Amazon machine in a few minutes (\nDeploying OpenVidu Demos on AWS\n). Then you can deploy your own app following these steps (\nDeploying OpenVidu Server and your app on AWS\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does OpenVidu work?\n\n\nWebRTC\n is the ultimate responsible for all media transmission at the very heart of OpenVidu. WebRTC is a modern, cross-platform framework that democratizes media transmission over the Internet. It is promoted by Google, Mozilla, Opera and others.\n\n\nKurento\n is the WebRTC framework on which OpenVidu is built. Openvidu was forked from \nKurentoRoom project\n.\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the differences between Kurento and OpenVidu?\n\n\nOpenVidu wraps and hides all the low-level operations. The main goal we pursue is to provide a simple, effective, easy-to-use API so you can forget about WebRTC, ICE candidates and media server tricky stuff. We internally use Kurento to generate, connect, modify and destroy media-pipelines, but OpenVidu simplifies as far as possible the process, focusing on the use-case of video-call sessions (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, users with different roles).\n\n\nUltimately, developers can create video-calls with just a few lines of code, all from their client-side\n.\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\nOpenVidu platform has been supported under project LERNIM (RTC-2016-4674-7) confunded by the \nMinistry of Economy, Finance and Competitiveness\n of Spain, as well as by the \nEuropean Union\n FEDER, whose main goal with this funds is to promote technological development, innovation and high-quality research.\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery-wellcome\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $('.docs-gallery').slick({\n      autoplay: true,\n      autoplaySpeed: 4000,\n      dots: true,\n      infinite: true,\n      pauseOnHover: false,\n      pauseOnFocus: false,\n      responsive: [\n      {\n        breakpoint: 768,\n        settings: {\n          arrows: false,\n          slidesToShow: 1\n        }\n      },\n    ]\n    });",

It has only 4 files:\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n: openvidu-browser library. You don't have to manipulate this file. \n\n\napp.js\n: sample application main JavaScritp file, which makes use of \nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n.\n\n\nstyle.css\n: some CSS classes to style \nindex.html\n.\n\n\nindex.html\n: HTML code for the form to connect to a video-call and for the video-call itself. It has two links to both JavaScript files: \n\n\n\n\n\n  \nscript src=\"openvidu-browser-VERSION.js\"\n/script\n\n\nscript src=\"app.js\"\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's see how \napp.js\n uses \nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n:\n\n\n\n\nFirst lines declare the two variables that will be needed in different points along the code. \nOV\n will be our OpenVidu object and \nsession\n the video-call we will connect to:\n\n\nvar OV;\nvar session;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitialize a new session and its events:\n\n\nOV = new OpenVidu();\nsession = OV.initSession(\nwss://\n + location.hostname + \n:8443/\n + sessionId + '?secret=MY_SECRET');\n\nsession.on('streamCreated', function (event) {\n    var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'subscriber');\n});\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the code, the process is very simple: get an OpenVidu object for initializing a Session object with it. \ninitSession\n method must recieve a string with the following format: \n\n\n\"wss://\"\n + \nOPENVIDU_IP\n + \n\":8443/\"\n + \nSESSION_ID\n + \n\"?secret=\"\n + \nOPENVIDU_SECRET\n\n\n\n\n\nOPENVIDU_IP\n  is the IP where your OpenVidu Server is running. In this case, it will be \nlocalhost\n.\n\n\nSESSION_ID\n is the unique identifier of your session. This parameter will determine which session you are connecting to: in this case, we get this from the HTML text input, where the user can type whatever he wants.\n\n\nOPENVIDU_SECRET\n is the same secret as used to initialize you OpenVidu Server (check param \nopenvidu.secret\n in step 4 of \nRunning this tutorial\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis parameter building process for \ninitrSession\n method is only necessary when your app has no server-side. Obviously in a production environment appending your secret is not recommended. Check \nthis FAQ\n to learn more.\n\n\n\n\nThen you can subscribe to all the events you want for your session. In this case we just want to subscribe to every stream that is being created in the session: on \nstreamCreated\n we subscribe to the specific stream, available at \nevent.stream\n property.\n\n\n\n\nYou can take a look at all the events in the \nReference Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect to the session and publish your webcam:\n\n\nsession.connect(null, function (error) {\n\n  if (!error) {\n    var publisher = OV.initPublisher('publisher');\n    session.publish(publisher);\n  } else {\n    console.log('There was an error connecting to the session:', error.code, error.message);\n  }\n\n});\n\n\n\n\nWe simply need to call \nsession.connect\n method providing a callback to execute when the operation is completed. First parameter \nnull\n is now irrelevant because we have no server-side (check the \nFAQ\n).\n\n\nThe only parameter received by our callback is \nerror\n object, which will be undefined if everything has gone well. To publish our webcam to the session we just get a \npublisher\n (thanks to \nOpenVidu.initPublisher\n method), and a new HTML video showing our webcam will be appended to the page inside element with id \npublisher\n.\n\n\nLast but not least, we publish this \npublisher\n object thanks to \nsession.publish\n. At this point the rest of users connected to this session will trigger their own \nstreamCreated\n event and can start watching our webcam.\n\n\n\n\nLeaving the session:\n\n\nsession.disconnect();\n\n\n\n\nWhenever we want a user to leave the session, we just need to call \nsession.disconnect\n method. Here it will be called inside \nleaveSession\n function, triggered when the user clicks on \"LEAVE\" button.",

You don't have to manipulate this file. \n\n\napp.js\n: sample application main JavaScritp file, which makes use of \nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n.

As there's no server, this parameter must start with the URL of\n// OpenVidu Server (with secure websocket protocol: \nwss://\n) and must include the OpenVidu secret at the end\nsession = OV.initSession(\nwss://\n + location.hostname + \n:8443/\n + sessionId + '?secret=MY_SECRET');\n\n\n\n\nSession's identifiers must begin with the URL where \nopenvidu-server\n listens, so they can connect through WebSocket to it. It is necessary to explicitly set this URL in the param when using a pure frontend web. Since we are in a local sample app, \nOV.initSession\n will finally receive \nwss://localhost:8443/\n as its \nopenvidu-server\n URL. \nsessionId\n is the distinctive portion of the session identifier and allows OpenVidu to differentiate sessions from each other. In this case, this parameter is retrieved from HTML input \ninput class=\"form-control\" type=\"text\" id=\"sessionId\" required\n, which may be filled by the user. Finally, \n'?secret=MY_SECRET'\n string allows us to connect to OpenVidu directly from the browser, without a server side. \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \nWARNING\n: this is only for demos and developing environments. Do NOT include your secret in production. Check this \nFAQ\n to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// --- 2) Specify the actions when events take place ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nsession.on('streamCreated', function (event) {\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it. HTML video will be appended to element with 'video-container' id\n    var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'video-container');\n\n    // When the HTML video has been appended to DOM...\n    subscriber.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {\n\n        // Add a new \np\n element for the user's nickname just below its video\n        appendUserData(event.element, subscriber.stream.connection);\n    });\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nsession.on('streamDestroyed', function (event) {\n\n    // Delete the HTML element with the user's nickname. HTML videos are automatically removed from DOM\n    removeUserData(event.stream.connection);\n});\n\n\n\n\nHere we subscribe to the events that interest us. In this case, we want to receive all videos published to the video-call, as well as displaying every user's nickname next to its video. To achieve this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstreamCreated\n: for each new Stream received by OpenVidu, we immediately subscribe to it so we can see its video. A new HTML video element will be appended to element with id 'video-container'. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nvideoElementCreated\n: event triggered by Subscriber object (returned by the previous \nSession.subscribe\n method). This allows us to add the participant nickname to the new video previously added in \nstreamCreated\n event. Auxiliary method \nappendUserData\n is responsible for appending a new paragraph element just below the \nevent.element\n video, containing \nsubscriber.stream.connection.data\n field. In this case, this field contains the user's nickName. You can see how to feed this property from the client in the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstreamDestroyed\n: for each Stream that has been destroyed (which means a user has left the video-call), we remove the element with the user's nickname that we added in the previous event with the auxiliary method \nremoveUserData\n (\nappendUserData\n method created the element with an \nid\n containing \nevent.stream.connection.connectionId\n unique value, so we can now identify the right element to be removed). OpenVidu automatically deletes the proper video element by default, so we don't need to do anything else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck \nApplication specific methods\n section to see all the auxiliary methods used in this app\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally connect to the session and publish your webcam:\n\n\n// --- 3) Connect to the session ---\n\n    // First param irrelevant if your app has no server-side. Second param will be received by every user\n    // in Stream.connection.data property, which will be appended to DOM as the user's nickname\n    session.connect(null, '{\nclientData\n: \n' + userName + '\n}', function (error) {\n\n        // If the connection is successful, initialize a publisher and publish to the session\n        if (!error) {\n\n            // --- 4) Get your own camera stream with the desired resolution ---\n\n            var publisher = OV.initPublisher('video-container', {\n                audio: true,\n                video: true,\n                quality: 'MEDIUM'\n            });\n\n            // When our HTML video has been added to DOM...\n            publisher.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {\n                initMainVideo(event.element, userName);\n                appendUserData(event.element, userName);\n                event.element['muted']  = true;\n            });\n\n            // --- 5) Publish your stream ---\n\n            session.publish(publisher);\n\n        } else {\n            console.log('There was an error connecting to the session:', error.code, error.message);\n        }\n    });\n\n\n\n\nIn \nsession.connect\n method: first param is irrelevant when you don't have a backend (it is the user's token). Remember \nvideoElementCreated\n event, when we added the user's nickname to the HTML? Well, second parameter is the actual value you will receive in \nStream.connection.data\n property. So in this case it is a JSON formatted string with a \"clientData\" tag with \"token\" value, which is retrieved from HTML input \ninput type=\"text\" id=\"participantId\" required\n (filled by the user and also reused for the first \ntoken\n param).\n\n\nIn the callback of \nSession.connect\n method, we check the connection has been succesful (\nerror\n value must be \nnull\n) and right after that we get a \nPublisher\n object with both audio and video activated and MEDIUM quality. This process will end with the addition of a new HTML video element showing your camera, as a child of element with \nid\n 'video-container'. Event \nvideoElementCreated\n will be fired by the Publisher object just after this video is added to DOM, so we can subscribe to it and do whatever we want with it. In this case, we init a big video element with our video and append our nickname to it, by using auxiliary methods \ninitMainVideo\n and \nappendUserData\n.\n\n\nFinally we just have to publish \npublisher\n object through \nSession.publish\n method, and the rest of users will begin receiving our webcam.\n\n\n\n\nLeaving the session:\n\n\nWhenever we want a user to leave the session, we just need to call \nsession.disconnect\n method:\n\n\nfunction leaveSession() {\n\n    // --- 6) Leave the session by calling 'disconnect' method over the Session object ---\n\n    session.disconnect();\n\n    // Removing all HTML elements with the user's nicknames. \n    // HTML videos are automatically removed when leaving a Session\n    removeAllUserData();\n\n    // Back to 'Join session' page\n    document.getElementById('join').style.display = 'block';\n    document.getElementById('session').style.display = 'none';\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication specific methods\n\n\nHere you have all the auxiliary methods used in this app, which are not directly related to OpenVidu:\n\n\n/* APPLICATION SPECIFIC METHODS */\n\nwindow.addEventListener('load', function () {\n    generateParticipantInfo();\n});\n\nwindow.onbeforeunload = function () {\n    if (session) session.disconnect();\n};\n\nfunction generateParticipantInfo() {\n    document.getElementById(\nsessionId\n).value = \nSessionA\n;\n    document.getElementById(\nuserName\n).value = \nParticipant\n + Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);\n}\n\nfunction appendUserData(videoElement, connection) {\n    var userData;\n    var nodeId;\n    if (typeof connection === \nstring\n) {\n        userData = connection;\n        nodeId = connection;\n    } else {\n        userData = JSON.parse(connection.data).clientData;\n        nodeId = connection.connectionId;\n    }\n    var dataNode = document.createElement('div');\n    dataNode.className = \ndata-node\n;\n    dataNode.id = \ndata-\n + nodeId;\n    dataNode.innerHTML = \np\n + userData + \n/p\n;\n    videoElement.parentNode.insertBefore(dataNode, videoElement.nextSibling);\n    addClickListener(videoElement, userData);\n}\n\nfunction removeUserData(connection) {\n    var dataNode = document.getElementById(\ndata-\n + connection.connectionId);\n    dataNode.parentNode.removeChild(dataNode);\n}\n\nfunction removeAllUserData() {\n    var nicknameElements = document.getElementsByClassName('data-node');\n    while (nicknameElements[0]) {\n        nicknameElements[0].parentNode.removeChild(nicknameElements[0]);\n    }\n}\n\nfunction addClickListener(videoElement, userData) {\n    videoElement.addEventListener('click', function () {\n        var mainVideo = document.querySelector('#main-video video');\n        var mainUserData = document.querySelector('#main-video p');\n        if (mainVideo.srcObject !== videoElement.srcObject) {\n            mainUserData.innerHTML = userData;\n            mainVideo.srcObject = videoElement.srcObject;\n        }\n    });\n}\n\nfunction initMainVideo(videoElement, userData) {\n    document.querySelector('#main-video video').srcObject = videoElement.srcObject;\n    document.querySelector('#main-video p').innerHTML = userData;\n    document.querySelector('#main-video video')['muted'] = true;\n}\n\n/* APPLICATION SPECIFIC METHODS */\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

In this case, we want to receive all videos published to the video-call, as well as displaying every user's nickname next to its video. To achieve this:    streamCreated : for each new Stream received by OpenVidu, we immediately subscribe to it so we can see its video. A new HTML video element will be appended to element with id 'video-container'.     videoElementCreated : event triggered by Subscriber object (returned by the previous  Session.subscribe  method). This allows us to add the participant nickname to the new video previously added in  streamCreated  event. Auxiliary method  appendUserData  is responsible for appending a new paragraph element just below the  event.element  video, containing  subscriber.stream.connection.data  field. In this case, this field contains the user's nickName. You can see how to feed this property from the client in the next step.    streamDestroyed : for each Stream that has been destroyed (which means a user has left the video-call), we remove the element with the user's nickname that we added in the previous event with the auxiliary method  removeUserData  ( appendUserData  method created the element with an  id  containing  event.stream.connection.connectionId  unique value, so we can now identify the right element to be removed).

We will focus on the following files under \nsrc/app/\n folder:\n\n\n\n\napp.component.ts\n: AppComponent, main component of the app. It contains the functionalities for joining a video-call and for handling the video-calls themselves.\n\n\napp.component.html\n: HTML for AppComponent.\n\n\napp.component.css\n: CSS for AppComponent.\n\n\nstream.component.css\n: StreamComponent, auxiliary component to manage Stream objects on our own. It wraps the final HTML \nvideo\n which will display the video of its Stream property, as well as the user's nickname in a \np\n element.\n\n\n\n\nLet's see how \napp.component.ts\n uses NPM package \nopenvidu-browser\n:\n\n\n\n\nFirst line imports the necessary objects from \nopenvidu-browser\n:\n\n\nimport { OpenVidu, Session, Stream } from 'openvidu-browser';\n\n\n\n\n\n\napp.component.ts\n declares the following properties:\n\n\n// OpenVidu objects\nOV: OpenVidu;\nsession: Session;\n\n// Streams to feed StreamComponent's\nremoteStreams: Stream[] = [];\nlocalStream: Stream;\n\n// Join form\nsessionId: string;\ntoken: string;\n\n// Main video of the page, will be 'localStream' or one of the 'remoteStreams',\n// updated by an Output event of StreamComponent children\n@Input() mainVideoStream: Stream;\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu\n object will allow us to get a \nSession\n object, which is declared just after it. \nremoteStreams\n array will store the active streams of other users in the video-call and \nlocalStream\n will be your own local webcam stream. Finally, \nsessionId\n and \ntoken\n params simply represent the video-call and your participant's nickname, as you will see in a moment.\n\n\n\n\nWhenever a user clicks on the submit input defined in \napp.component.html\n, \njoinSession()\n method is called:\n\n\n// --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object and init a session with a sessionId ---\n\n// Init OpenVidu object\nthis.OV = new OpenVidu();\n\n// We will join the video-call \nsessionId\n. As there's no server, this parameter must start with the URL of\n// OpenVidu Server (with secure websocket protocol: \nwss://\n) and must include the OpenVidu secret at the end\nthis.session = this.OV.initSession('wss://' + location.hostname + ':8443/' + this.sessionId + '?secret=MY_SECRET');\n\n\n\n\nSession's identifiers must begin with the URL where \nopenvidu-server\n listens, so they can connect through WebSocket to it. It is necessary to explicitly set this URL in the param when using a pure frontend web. Since we are in a local sample app, \nOV.initSession\n will finally receive \nwss://localhost:8443/\n as its \nopenvidu-server\n URL. \nsessionId\n is the distinctive portion of the session identifier and allows OpenVidu to differentiate sessions from each other. In this case, this parameter is retrieved from HTML input \ninput class=\"form-control\" type=\"text\" id=\"sessionId\" ... \n, which may be filled by the user. Finally, \n'?secret=MY_SECRET'\n string allows us to connect to OpenVidu directly from the browser, without a server side.\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \nWARNING\n: this is only for demos and developing environments. Do NOT include your secret in production. Check this \nFAQ\n to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// --- 2) Specify the actions when events take place ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nthis.session.on('streamCreated', (event) =\n {\n\n    // Add the new stream to 'remoteStreams' array\n    this.remoteStreams.push(event.stream);\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it.

As we are using Angular framework, a good approach will be treating each Stream as a component, contained in a StreamComponent. Thus, we need to store each new stream we received in an array (\nremoteStreams\n), and we must remove from it every deleted stream whenever it is necessary. To achieve this, we use the following events:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstreamCreated\n: for each new Stream received by OpenVidu, we store it in our \nremoteStreams\n array and immediately subscribe to it so we can receive its video (empty string as second parameter, so OpenVidu doesn't create an HTML video on its own). HTML template of AppComponent will show the new video, as it contains an \nngFor\n directive which will create a new StreamComponent for each Stream object stored in the array:\n\n\ndiv *ngFor=\"let s of this.remoteStreams\" class=\"stream-container col-md-6 col-xs-6\"\n\n  \nstream-component [stream]=\"s\" (mainVideoStream)=\"getMainVideoStream($event)\"\n/stream-component\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstreamDestroyed\n: for each Stream that has been destroyed (which means a user has left the video-call), we remove it from \nremoteStreams\n array, so Angular will automatically delete the required StreamComponent from HTML. We call \nevent.preventDefault()\n to cancel OpenVidu default behaviour towards \nstreamDestroyed\n event, which is the deletion of the previously created HTML video element on \nstreamCreated\n event. Because we are handling the video elements by ourselves taking advantage of Angular capabilities, we tell OpenVidu not to create them on \nstreamCreated\n and not to delete them on \nstreamDestroyed\n, by passing an empty string as second parameter on \nSession.subscribe()\n method on \nstreamCreated\n and by calling \nevent.preventDefault()\n on \nstreamDestroyed\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally connect to the session and publish your webcam:\n\n\n\n// --- 3) Connect to the session ---\n\n// First param irrelevant if your app has no server-side. Second param will be received by every user\n// in Stream.connection.data property, which will be appended to DOM as the user's nickname\nthis.session.connect(null, '{\nclientData\n: \n' + this.userName + '\n}', (error) =\n {\n\n    // If connection successful, initialize a publisher and publish to the session\n    if (!error) {\n\n        // --- 4) Get your own camera stream with the desired resolution ---\n\n        // Both audio and video will be active. Second parameter is an empty string\n        // so OpenVidu doesn't create an HTML video by its own\n        let publisher = this.OV.initPublisher('', {\n            audio: true,\n            video: true,\n            quality: 'MEDIUM'\n        });\n\n        // Store your webcam stream in 'localStream' object\n        this.localStream = publisher.stream;\n        // Set the main video in the page to display our webcam\n        this.mainVideoStream = this.localStream;\n\n        // --- 5) Publish your stream ---\n\n        this.session.publish(publisher);\n\n    } else {\n        console.log('There was an error connecting to the session:', error.code, error.message);\n    }\n});\n\n\n\n\nIn \nsession.connect\n method: first param is irrelevant when you don't have a backend (it is the user's token). Remember \nvideoElementCreated\n event, when we added the user's nickname to the HTML? Well, second parameter is the actual value you will receive in \nStream.connection.data\n property. So in this case it is a JSON formatted string with a \"clientData\" tag with \"token\" value, which is retrieved from HTML input \ninput type=\"text\" id=\"participantId\" required\n (filled by the user and also reused for the first \ntoken\n param).\n\n\nIn the callback of \nSession.connect\n method, we check the connection has been succesful (\nerror\n value must be \nnull\n) and right after that we get a \nPublisher\n object with both audio and video activated and MEDIUM quality. We then store our local Stream (contained in \nPublisher.stream\n object) in \nlocalStream\n, make our main video display our stream and publish the Publisher object through \nSession.publish()\n method. The rest of users will receive our Stream object and will execute their \nstreamCreated\n event.\n\n\nWith regard to our local Stream, AppComponent's HTML template has also one StreamComponent declaration ready to show our own webcam as we did with remote streams:\n\n\ndiv *ngIf=\nthis.localStream\n class=\nstream-container col-md-6 col-xs-6\n\n    \nstream-component [stream]=\nthis.localStream\n (mainVideoStream)=\ngetMainVideoStream($event)\n/stream-component\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nLast point worth considering is the implementation of StreamComponent. As we are handling Stream objects by ourselves (task which usually is taken care by OpenVidu), and because the URL of Stream objects takes some time to get its final value as the WebRTC negotiation takes place, we must listen to any change in \nstream\n @Input property. We do so getting the \nHTMLVideoElement\n from our view on \nngAfterViewInit()\n hook method (attribute \nvideoElement\n), and then listening to \nngDoCheck()\n. This allows us to update \nvideoElement.srcObject\n value, which is the ultimate property that indicates our\nvideo\n element where to receive the media stream. If we didn't do this, the Stream object will update its \nsrcObject\n property, but our StreamComponent would keep the same initial \nvideoElement.srcObject\n value. This ensures that all our StreamComponent's will properly display all the videos in the video-call using the correct \nsrcOjbect\n value.\n\n\ngetNickNameTag()\n method feeds the view of StreamComponent with the nickName of the user. Remember \nsession.connect\n method and its second param? It can be now found at \nstream.connection.data\n, so every user will receive the nickName of others.\n\n\nvideoClicked()\n tells our AppComponent parent that the user has clicked on certain video, and that the main view should update the main video stream.\n\n\nngAfterViewInit() { // Get HTMLVideoElement from the view\n    this.videoElement = this.elementRef.nativeElement;\n}\n\nngDoCheck() { // Detect any change in 'stream' property (specifically in its 'srcObject' property)\n    if (this.videoElement \n (this.videoElement.srcObject !== this.stream.getVideoSrcObject())) {\n        this.videoElement.srcObject = this.stream.getVideoSrcObject();\n    }\n}\n\ngetNicknameTag() { // Gets the nickName of the user\n    return JSON.parse(this.stream.connection.data).clientData;\n}\n\nvideoClicked() { // Triggers event for the parent component to update its view\n    this.mainVideoStream.next(this.stream);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaving the session:\n\n\nWhenever we want a user to leave the session, we just need to call \nsession.disconnect\n method:\n\n\nleaveSession() {\n\n    // --- 6) Leave the session by calling 'disconnect' method over the Session object ---\n    if (this.OV) { this.session.disconnect(); };\n\n    ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

It also stores our active video-calls and the users connected to them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend\n: Pure JS/HTML/CSS files (\nsrc/main/resources/static\n)\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n : openvidu-browser library. You don't have to manipulate this file. \n\n\napp.js\n : sample application main JavaScritp file, which makes use of \nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n.\n\n\n\n\nindex.html\n : HTML code for the form to login, the form to connect to a video-call and for the video-call itself. It has two links to both JavaScript files:\n\n\nscript src=\"openvidu-browser-VERSION.js\"\n/script\n\n\nscript src=\"app.js\"\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstyle.css\n: some CSS classes to style \nindex.html\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's describe the code following this scenario: a user logs in to the app and connects to the video-call \"TUTORIAL\", where he publishes his webcam. A second user will connect to the same video-call just after that and publish its own webcam. Both of them will leave the call after a while.\n\n\n\n\n1)  User logs in\n\n\nWe have implemented a method for making HTTP requests to the backend, as we will need to make at least three of them: one for logging in, one for getting the sessionId and a valid token from openvidu-server and one for letting know our backend when any user leaves the video-call. The header of the method looks like this:\n\n\nfunction httpRequest(method, url, body, errorMsg, callback)\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nmethod\n is whether \"POST\" or \"GET\", \nurl\n the path of the REST operation, \nbody\n the data to be passed, \nerrorMsg\n the output error message if something goes wrong and \ncallback\n the function to execute in case of success. As mentioned above, we need to call this method three times for each user that LOGS IN \ud83e\udc52 CONNECTS TO A VIDEO-CALL \ud83e\udc52 LEAVES THE VIDEO-CALL.\n\n\nindex.html\n will first show a form to log in:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\napp.js\n sends an HTTP request to \"/api-login/login\" passing the username and the password retrieved from the HTML form whenever \"Log in\" button is clicked:\n\n\nfunction logIn() {\n    var user = $(\n#user\n).val(); // Username\n    var pass = $(\n#pass\n).val(); // Password\n    var jsonBody = JSON.stringify({ // Body of POST request\n        'user': user,\n        'pass': pass\n    });\n\n    httpRequest('POST', '/api-login/login', jsonBody, 'Login WRONG',\n      function successCallback(response){ // Send POST request\n        console.warn(userName + ' login');\n        // HTML shows logged-in page ...\n    });\n}\n\n\n\n\nLoginController.java\n checks the params are correct and if so sets an \nHttpSession\n for the newly logged user (adding a \"loggedUser\" attribute with its username in the HttpSession object):\n\n\n@RequestMapping(value = \n/login\n, method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic ResponseEntity\nObject\n login(@RequestBody String userPass, HttpSession httpSession) throws ParseException {\n\n    // Retrieve params from POST body\n    JSONObject userPassJson = (JSONObject) new JSONParser().parse(userPass);\n    String user = (String) userPassJson.get(\nuser\n);\n    String pass = (String) userPassJson.get(\npass\n);\n\n    if (login(user, pass)) { // Correct user-pass\n        // Validate session and return OK \n        // Value stored in HttpSession allows us to identify the user in future requests\n        httpSession.setAttribute(\nloggedUser\n, user);\n        return new ResponseEntity\n(HttpStatus.OK);\n    } else { // Wrong user-pass\n        // Invalidate session and return error\n        httpSession.invalidate();\n        return new ResponseEntity\n(\nUser/Pass incorrect\n, HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) User connects to \"TUTORIAL\" video-call\n\n\nHTML will display now the user has logged a different form, asking for the video-call to connect and the nickname the user wants to have in it. So our 'publisher1' user would write TUTORIAL in \"Session\" field and press \"Join!\" button:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\napp.js\n will execute \njoinSession()\n method, which starts like this:\n\n\nfunction joinSession() {\n    getSessionIdAndToken(function () { ...\n\n\n\n\nSo the first thing to do here is to retrieve a \nsessionId\n and a \ntoken\n from our backend. Only when we have them available in the browser we will continue with the \njoin\n operation. Let's see what \ngetSessionIdAndToken()\n looks like:\n\n\nfunction getSessionIdAndToken(callback) {\n    sessionName = $(\n#sessionName\n).val(); // Video-call chosen by the user (\nTUTORIAL\n)\n    nickName = $(\n#participantName\n).val(); // Nickname chosen by the user\n\n    var jsonBody = JSON.stringify({ // Body of POST request\n        'session': sessionName\n    });\n\n    // Send POST request\n    httpRequest('POST', '/api-sessions/get-sessionid-token', jsonBody, \n     'Request of SESSIONID and TOKEN gone WRONG:', function successCallback(response){\n        sessionId = response[0]; // Get sessionId from response\n        token = response[1]; // Get token from response\n        callback(); // Continue the join operation\n    });\n}\n\n\n\n\nHere is the second time we must call our \nhttpRequest()\n method, sending the session we want to connect (\"TUTORIAL\") and waiting to get a \nsessionId\n and a \ntoken\n as response. The interesting part here is in \nSessionController.java\n. First of all there are some important attributes in this class we must mention:\n\n\n// OpenVidu object to ask openvidu-server for sessionId and token\nprivate OpenVidu openVidu;\n\n// Collection to pair session names and OpenVidu Session objects\nprivate Map\nString, Session\n mapSessions = new ConcurrentHashMap\n();\n// Collection to pair sessionId's and tokens (the inner Map pairs tokens and role associated)\nprivate Map\nString, Map\nString, OpenViduRole\n mapSessionIdsTokens = new ConcurrentHashMap\n();\n\n// URL where our OpenVidu server is listening\nprivate String OPENVIDU_URL;\n// Secret shared with our OpenVidu server\nprivate String SECRET;\n\n\n\n\nRest controller method begins retrieving the param send by the client, which in this case is the video-call name (\"TUTORIAL\"), as well as preparing a param we will need a little further on: \ntokenOptions\n.\n\n\n@RequestMapping(value = \n/api-sessions/get-sessionid-token\n, method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic ResponseEntity\nJSONObject\n getSessionIdToken(@RequestBody String sessionNameParam, \n        HttpSession httpSession) throws ParseException {\n    // Check the user is logged ... \n\n    JSONObject sessionJSON = (JSONObject) new JSONParser().parse(sessionNameParam);\n\n    // The video-call to connect (\nTUTORIAL\n)\n    String sessionName = (String) sessionJSON.get(\nsession\n);\n\n    // Role associated to this user\n    OpenViduRole role = LoginController.users.get(httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n)).role;\n\n    // Optional data to be passed to other users when this user connects to the video-call\n    // In this case, a JSON with the value we stored in the HttpSession object on login\n    String serverData = \n{\\\nserverData\\\n: \\\n + httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n) + \n\\\n}\n;\n\n    // Build tokenOptions object with the serverData and the role\n    TokenOptions tokenOptions = new TokenOptions.Builder().data(serverData).role(role).build();\n\n    JSONObject responseJson = new JSONObject();\n\n\n\n\nJust after that an \nif-else\n statement comes into play: does the session \"TUTORIAL\" already exist? \n\n\nif (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null) { ...\n\n\n\n\nIn this case it doesn't because 'publisher1' is the first user connecting to it. So we focus on the \nelse\n branch:\n\n\nelse {\n    // New session: return a new sessionId and a new token\n    try {\n\n        // Create a new OpenVidu Session\n        Session session = this.openVidu.createSession();\n        // Get the sessionId\n        String sessionId = session.getSessionId();\n        // Generate a new token with the recently created tokenOptions\n        String token = session.generateToken(tokenOptions);\n\n        // Store the session and the token in our collections\n        this.mapSessions.put(sessionName, session);\n        this.mapSessionIdsTokens.put(sessionId, new ConcurrentHashMap\n());\n        this.mapSessionIdsTokens.get(sessionId).put(token, role);\n\n        // Prepare the response with the sessionId and the token\n        responseJson.put(0, sessionId);\n        responseJson.put(1, token);\n\n        // Return the response to the client\n        return new ResponseEntity\n(responseJson, HttpStatus.OK);\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // If error generate an error message and return it to client\n        return getErrorResponse(e);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe are almost there! Now in \napp.js\n we can init a new Session with \nsessionId\n and connect to it with \ntoken\n:\n\n\n// --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object and init a session with the retrieved sessionId ---\n\nOV = new OpenVidu();\nsession = OV.initSession(sessionId);\n\n\n// --- 2) Specify the actions when events take place ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nsession.on('streamCreated', function (event) {\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it\n    // HTML video will be appended to element with 'video-container' id\n    var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'video-container');\n\n    // When the HTML video has been appended to DOM...\n    subscriber.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {\n\n        // Add a new HTML element for the user's name and nickname over its video\n        appendUserData(event.element, subscriber.stream.connection);\n    });\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nsession.on('streamDestroyed', function (event) {\n    // Delete the HTML element with the user's name and nickname\n    removeUserData(event.stream.connection);\n});\n\n\n// --- 3) Connect to the session passing the retrieved token and some more data from\n//         the client (in this case a JSON with the nickname chosen by the user) ---\n\nsession.connect(token, '{\nclientData\n: \n' + nickName + '\n}', function (error) {\n\n    // If the connection is successful, initialize a publisher and publish to the session\n    if (!error) {\n\n        // Here we check somehow if the user has at least 'PUBLISHER' role before\n        // trying to publish its stream. Even if someone modified the client's code and\n        // published the stream, it wouldn't work if the token sent in Session.connect\n        // method doesn't belong to a 'PUBLIHSER' role\n        if (isPublisher()) {\n\n            // --- 4) Get your own camera stream ---\n\n            var publisher = OV.initPublisher('video-container', {\n                audio: true,\n                video: true,\n                quality: 'MEDIUM'\n            });\n\n            // When our HTML video has been added to DOM...\n            publisher.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {\n                // Init the main video with ours and append our data\n                var userData = {\n                    nickName: nickName,\n                    userName: userName\n                };\n                initMainVideo(event.element, userData);\n                appendUserData(event.element, userData);\n                $(event.element).prop('muted', true); // Mute local video\n            });\n\n\n            // --- 5) Publish your stream ---\n\n            session.publish(publisher);\n\n        } else {\n            console.warn('You don\\'t have permissions to publish');\n            initMainVideoThumbnail(); // Show SUBSCRIBER message in main video\n        }\n    } else {\n        console.warn('There was an error connecting to the session:', error.code, error.message);\n    }\n});\n\n// HTML shows session page ...\n\n\n\n\nThe user will now see its own video on the page. The connection to the session has completed!\n\n\n\n\n3) Another user connects to the video-call\n\n\nThe process would be exactly the same as before until \nSessionController.java\n executes \ngetSessionIdAndToken()\n method. Now session 'TUTORIAL' already exists, so in the \nif-else\n statement the \nif\n branch would be the one executed:\n\n\nif (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null) {\n    // Session already exists: return existing sessionId and a new token\n    try {\n\n        // Get the existing sessionId from our collection with \n        // the sessionName param (\nTUTORIAL\n)\n        String sessionId = this.mapSessions.get(sessionName).getSessionId();\n        // Generate a new token with the recently created tokenOptions\n        String token = this.mapSessions.get(sessionName).generateToken(tokenOptions);\n\n        // Update our collection storing the new token\n        this.mapSessionIdsTokens.get(sessionId).put(token, role);\n\n        // Prepare the response with the sessionId and the token\n        responseJson.put(0, sessionId);\n        responseJson.put(1, token);\n\n        // Return the response to the client\n        return new ResponseEntity\n(responseJson, HttpStatus.OK);\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // If error generate an error message and return it to client\n        return getErrorResponse(e);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe code executed in \napp.js\n would also be the same. After the \nSession.publish()\n method has been succesful, both users will be seeing each other's video, as well as the username and the nickname below it.\n\n\n\n\n4) Users leave the video-call\n\n\nAfter a while both users decide to leave the session. Apart from calling \nleaveSession()\n (and therefore \nsession.disconnect()\n) to destroy the connection on openvidu-server, we need to run the last HTTP operation: we must let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens. To sum up, \nsession.disconnect()\n updates our openvidu-server and the POST operation updates our backend.\nFor the POST operation, in \napp.js\n we run:\n\n\nfunction removeUser() {\n    // Body of POST request with the name of the session and the token of the leaving user\n    var jsonBody = JSON.stringify({\n        'sessionName': sessionName,\n        'token': token\n    });\n\n    // Send POST request\n    httpRequest('POST', '/api-sessions/remove-user', jsonBody,\n        'User couldn\\'t be removed from session', function successCallback(response) {\n        console.warn(userName + ' correctly removed from session ' + sessionName);\n    });\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd in \nSessionController.java\n we update the collections:\n\n\n@RequestMapping(value = \n/api-sessions/remove-user\n, method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic ResponseEntity\nJSONObject\n removeUser(@RequestBody String sessionNameToken, \n    HttpSession httpSession) throws Exception {\n    // Check the user is logged ... \n\n    // Retrieve the params from BODY\n    JSONObject sessionNameTokenJSON = (JSONObject) new JSONParser().parse(sessionNameToken);\n    String sessionName = (String) sessionNameTokenJSON.get(\nsessionName\n);\n    String token = (String) sessionNameTokenJSON.get(\ntoken\n);\n\n    // If the session exists (\nTUTORIAL\n in this case)\n    if (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null) {\n        String sessionId = this.mapSessions.get(sessionName).getSessionId();\n\n        if (this.mapSessionIdsTokens.containsKey(sessionId)) {\n            // If the token exists\n            if (this.mapSessionIdsTokens.get(sessionId).remove(token) != null) {\n                // User left the session\n                if (this.mapSessionIdsTokens.get(sessionId).isEmpty()) {\n                    // Last user left: session \nTUTORIAL\n must be removed\n                    this.mapSessions.remove(sessionName);\n                }\n                return new ResponseEntity\n(HttpStatus.OK);\n            } else {\n                // The TOKEN wasn't valid\n                return new ResponseEntity\n(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\n            }\n        } else {\n            // The SESSIONID wasn't valid\n            return new ResponseEntity\n(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\n        }\n    } else {\n        // The SESSION does not exist\n        return new ResponseEntity\n(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen the last user leaves the session \nthis.mapSessions.remove(sessionName);\n will be executed: this means the session is empty and that it is going to be closed. The \nsessionId\n and all \ntoken\n params associated to it will be invalidated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point we have covered all the important code from the tutorial. With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches: \nyou can implement your frontend and your backend as you want\n. \n\n\nThe only actual requirements are getting \nsessionId\n and \ntoken\n params from  \nopenvidu-server\n (by using one of the available clients or with the REST API) and using them along with \nopenvidu-browser\n to connect your clients to the sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

            "text": "HTML will display now the user has logged a different form, asking for the video-call to connect and the nickname the user wants to have in it. So our 'publisher1' user would write TUTORIAL in \"Session\" field and press \"Join!\" button:  \n     app.js  will execute  joinSession()  method, which starts like this:  function joinSession() {\n    getSessionIdAndToken(function () { ...  So the first thing to do here is to retrieve a  sessionId  and a  token  from our backend. Only when we have them available in the browser we will continue with the  join  operation. Let's see what  getSessionIdAndToken()  looks like:  function getSessionIdAndToken(callback) {\n    sessionName = $( #sessionName ).val(); // Video-call chosen by the user ( TUTORIAL )\n    nickName = $( #participantName ).val(); // Nickname chosen by the user\n\n    var jsonBody = JSON.stringify({ // Body of POST request\n        'session': sessionName\n    });\n\n    // Send POST request\n    httpRequest('POST', '/api-sessions/get-sessionid-token', jsonBody, \n     'Request of SESSIONID and TOKEN gone WRONG:', function successCallback(response){\n        sessionId = response[0]; // Get sessionId from response\n        token = response[1]; // Get token from response\n        callback(); // Continue the join operation\n    });\n}  Here is the second time we must call our  httpRequest()  method, sending the session we want to connect (\"TUTORIAL\") and waiting to get a  sessionId  and a  token  as response. The interesting part here is in  SessionController.java . First of all there are some important attributes in this class we must mention:  // OpenVidu object to ask openvidu-server for sessionId and token\nprivate OpenVidu openVidu;\n\n// Collection to pair session names and OpenVidu Session objects\nprivate Map String, Session  mapSessions = new ConcurrentHashMap ();\n// Collection to pair sessionId's and tokens (the inner Map pairs tokens and role associated)\nprivate Map String, Map String, OpenViduRole  mapSessionIdsTokens = new ConcurrentHashMap ();\n\n// URL where our OpenVidu server is listening\nprivate String OPENVIDU_URL;\n// Secret shared with our OpenVidu server\nprivate String SECRET;  Rest controller method begins retrieving the param send by the client, which in this case is the video-call name (\"TUTORIAL\"), as well as preparing a param we will need a little further on:  tokenOptions .  @RequestMapping(value =  /api-sessions/get-sessionid-token , method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic ResponseEntity JSONObject  getSessionIdToken(@RequestBody String sessionNameParam, \n        HttpSession httpSession) throws ParseException {\n    // Check the user is logged ... \n\n    JSONObject sessionJSON = (JSONObject) new JSONParser().parse(sessionNameParam);\n\n    // The video-call to connect ( TUTORIAL )\n    String sessionName = (String) sessionJSON.get( session );\n\n    // Role associated to this user\n    OpenViduRole role = LoginController.users.get(httpSession.getAttribute( loggedUser )).role;\n\n    // Optional data to be passed to other users when this user connects to the video-call\n    // In this case, a JSON with the value we stored in the HttpSession object on login\n    String serverData =  {\\ serverData\\ : \\  + httpSession.getAttribute( loggedUser ) +  \\ } ;\n\n    // Build tokenOptions object with the serverData and the role\n    TokenOptions tokenOptions = new TokenOptions.Builder().data(serverData).role(role).build();\n\n    JSONObject responseJson = new JSONObject();  Just after that an  if-else  statement comes into play: does the session \"TUTORIAL\" already exist?   if (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null) { ...  In this case it doesn't because 'publisher1' is the first user connecting to it. So we focus on the  else  branch:  else {\n    // New session: return a new sessionId and a new token\n    try {\n\n        // Create a new OpenVidu Session\n        Session session = this.openVidu.createSession();\n        // Get the sessionId\n        String sessionId = session.getSessionId();\n        // Generate a new token with the recently created tokenOptions\n        String token = session.generateToken(tokenOptions);\n\n        // Store the session and the token in our collections\n        this.mapSessions.put(sessionName, session);\n        this.mapSessionIdsTokens.put(sessionId, new ConcurrentHashMap ());\n        this.mapSessionIdsTokens.get(sessionId).put(token, role);\n\n        // Prepare the response with the sessionId and the token\n        responseJson.put(0, sessionId);\n        responseJson.put(1, token);\n\n        // Return the response to the client\n        return new ResponseEntity (responseJson, HttpStatus.OK);\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // If error generate an error message and return it to client\n        return getErrorResponse(e);\n    }\n}  We are almost there! Now in  app.js  we can init a new Session with  sessionId  and connect to it with  token :  // --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object and init a session with the retrieved sessionId ---\n\nOV = new OpenVidu();\nsession = OV.initSession(sessionId);\n\n\n// --- 2) Specify the actions when events take place ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nsession.on('streamCreated', function (event) {\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it\n    // HTML video will be appended to element with 'video-container' id\n    var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'video-container');\n\n    // When the HTML video has been appended to DOM...\n    subscriber.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {\n\n        // Add a new HTML element for the user's name and nickname over its video\n        appendUserData(event.element, subscriber.stream.connection);\n    });\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nsession.on('streamDestroyed', function (event) {\n    // Delete the HTML element with the user's name and nickname\n    removeUserData(event.stream.connection);\n});\n\n\n// --- 3) Connect to the session passing the retrieved token and some more data from\n//         the client (in this case a JSON with the nickname chosen by the user) ---\n\nsession.connect(token, '{ clientData :  ' + nickName + ' }', function (error) {\n\n    // If the connection is successful, initialize a publisher and publish to the session\n    if (!error) {\n\n        // Here we check somehow if the user has at least 'PUBLISHER' role before\n        // trying to publish its stream. Even if someone modified the client's code and\n        // published the stream, it wouldn't work if the token sent in Session.connect\n        // method doesn't belong to a 'PUBLIHSER' role\n        if (isPublisher()) {\n\n            // --- 4) Get your own camera stream ---\n\n            var publisher = OV.initPublisher('video-container', {\n                audio: true,\n                video: true,\n                quality: 'MEDIUM'\n            });\n\n            // When our HTML video has been added to DOM...\n            publisher.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {\n                // Init the main video with ours and append our data\n                var userData = {\n                    nickName: nickName,\n                    userName: userName\n                };\n                initMainVideo(event.element, userData);\n                appendUserData(event.element, userData);\n                $(event.element).prop('muted', true); // Mute local video\n            });\n\n\n            // --- 5) Publish your stream ---\n\n            session.publish(publisher);\n\n        } else {\n            console.warn('You don\\'t have permissions to publish');\n            initMainVideoThumbnail(); // Show SUBSCRIBER message in main video\n        }\n    } else {\n        console.warn('There was an error connecting to the session:', error.code, error.message);\n    }\n});\n\n// HTML shows session page ...

            "text": "After a while both users decide to leave the session. Apart from calling  leaveSession()  (and therefore  session.disconnect() ) to destroy the connection on openvidu-server, we need to run the last HTTP operation: we must let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens. To sum up,  session.disconnect()  updates our openvidu-server and the POST operation updates our backend.\nFor the POST operation, in  app.js  we run:  function removeUser() {\n    // Body of POST request with the name of the session and the token of the leaving user\n    var jsonBody = JSON.stringify({\n        'sessionName': sessionName,\n        'token': token\n    });\n\n    // Send POST request\n    httpRequest('POST', '/api-sessions/remove-user', jsonBody,\n        'User couldn\\'t be removed from session', function successCallback(response) {\n        console.warn(userName + ' correctly removed from session ' + sessionName);\n    });\n}  And in  SessionController.java  we update the collections:  @RequestMapping(value =  /api-sessions/remove-user , method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic ResponseEntity JSONObject  removeUser(@RequestBody String sessionNameToken, \n    HttpSession httpSession) throws Exception {\n    // Check the user is logged ... \n\n    // Retrieve the params from BODY\n    JSONObject sessionNameTokenJSON = (JSONObject) new JSONParser().parse(sessionNameToken);\n    String sessionName = (String) sessionNameTokenJSON.get( sessionName );\n    String token = (String) sessionNameTokenJSON.get( token );\n\n    // If the session exists ( TUTORIAL  in this case)\n    if (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null) {\n        String sessionId = this.mapSessions.get(sessionName).getSessionId();\n\n        if (this.mapSessionIdsTokens.containsKey(sessionId)) {\n            // If the token exists\n            if (this.mapSessionIdsTokens.get(sessionId).remove(token) != null) {\n                // User left the session\n                if (this.mapSessionIdsTokens.get(sessionId).isEmpty()) {\n                    // Last user left: session  TUTORIAL  must be removed\n                    this.mapSessions.remove(sessionName);\n                }\n                return new ResponseEntity (HttpStatus.OK);\n            } else {\n                // The TOKEN wasn't valid\n                return new ResponseEntity (HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\n            }\n        } else {\n            // The SESSIONID wasn't valid\n            return new ResponseEntity (HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\n        }\n    } else {\n        // The SESSION does not exist\n        return new ResponseEntity (HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\n    }\n}  When the last user leaves the session  this.mapSessions.remove(sessionName);  will be executed: this means the session is empty and that it is going to be closed. The  sessionId  and all  token  params associated to it will be invalidated.    At this point we have covered all the important code from the tutorial. With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches:  you can implement your frontend and your backend as you want .   The only actual requirements are getting  sessionId  and  token  params from   openvidu-server  (by using one of the available clients or with the REST API) and using them along with  openvidu-browser  to connect your clients to the sessions.     \n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

With regard to the use of OpenVidu, it is identical to \nopenvidu-js-java\n. This tutorial is intended for developers who feel more comfortable with MVC web architectures for their frontends. \nThymeleaf\n is the template engine of choice for this tutorial.\n\n\nUnderstanding this tutorial\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu is composed by the modules displayed on the image above.\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-browser\n: JavaScript library for the browser. It allows you to manage your video-calls straight away from your clients\n\n\nopenvidu-java-client\n: Java package to easily get the necessary params (sessionId's and tokens) from openvidu-server.

The easiest way is running this Docker container which wraps both of them (you will need \nDocker CE\n):\n\n\ndocker run -p 8443:8443 --rm -e KMS_STUN_IP=stun.l.google.com -e KMS_STUN_PORT=19302 -e openvidu.secret=MY_SECRET openvidu/openvidu-server-kms:1.1.0\n\n\n\n\n5) Go to \nhttps://localhost:5000\n to test the app once the server is running. The first time you use the docker container, an alert message will suggest you accept the self-signed certificate of \nopenvidu-server\n when you first try to join a video-call.

You can do this as you prefer. Here our backend will manage the users and their sessions with the easy-to-use and non-intrusive \nHttpSession\n API. In these posts multiple options for user session management in Java are explained, inlcuding the one used in this tutorial: \njournaldev.com\n, \nstudytonight.com\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackend\n: SpringBoot app with the following classes (\nsrc/main/java\n path, \nio.openvidu.js.java\n package)\n\n\n\n\nApp.java\n : entrypoint for the app\n\n\nLoginController.java\n : controller for handling login and logout operations\n\n\nSessionController.java\n : controller for getting sessionId's and tokens. It also stores our active video-calls and the users connected to them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend templates\n: Pure JS/HTML/CSS files served by the backend (\nsrc/main/resources/templates\n)\n\n\n\n\nindex.html\n : template with the login form\n\n\ndashboard.html\n : template with the form to join a video-call\n\n\nsession.html\n : template of the video-call itself\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend static files\n (\nsrc/main/resources/static\n)\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n : openvidu-browser library. You don't have to manipulate this file\n\n\nstyle.css\n : some CSS classes to style the templates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's describe the code following this scenario: a user logs in to the app and connects to the video-call \"TUTORIAL\", where he publishes his webcam. A second user will connect to the same video-call just after that and publish its own webcam. Both of them will leave the call after a while.\n\n\n\n\n1) User logs in\n\n\nAt path \n/\n a login form will be displayed:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe form will execute a POST operation to path \n/dashboard\n whenever \"Log in\" button is clicked, passing the username and the password:\n\n\nform class=\nform-group jumbotron\n action=\n/dashboard\n method=\npost\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nUser\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\ntext\n name=\nuser\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nPass\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\npassword\n name=\npass\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np class=\ntext-center\n\n        \nbutton class=\nbtn btn-lg btn-info\n type=\nsubmit\nLog in\n/button\n\n    \n/p\n\n\n/form\n\n\n\n\n\nLoginController.java\n first checks if the user is already logged (maybe he has just refreshed \n/dashboard\n page), and if so it just redirects to the dashboard itself. If the user is actually logging in, the method checks that the params are correct and if so sets an \nHttpSession\n for the newly logged user (adding a \"loggedUser\" attribute with its username in the HttpSession object). Finally it returns \ndashboard.html\n template:\n\n\n@RequestMapping(value = \n/dashboard\n, method = { RequestMethod.GET, RequestMethod.POST })\npublic String login(@RequestParam(name = \nuser\n, required = false) String user,\n            @RequestParam(name = \npass\n, required = false) String pass,\n            Model model, HttpSession httpSession) {\n\n    // Check if the user is already logged in\n    String userName = (String) httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n);\n    if (userName != null) { \n        // User is already logged. Immediately return dashboard\n        model.addAttribute(\nusername\n, userName);\n        return \ndashboard\n;\n    }\n\n    // User wasn't logged and wants to\n    if (login(user, pass)) { // Correct user-pass\n\n        // Validate session and return OK \n        // Value stored in HttpSession allows us to identify the user in future requests\n        httpSession.setAttribute(\nloggedUser\n, user);\n        model.addAttribute(\nusername\n, user);\n\n        // Return dashboard.html template\n        return \ndashboard\n;\n\n    } else { // Wrong user-pass\n        // Invalidate session and redirect to index.html\n        httpSession.invalidate();\n        return \nredirect:/\n;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) User connects to \"TUTORIAL\" video-call\n\n\ndashboard.html\n template will display a form asking for the video-call to connect and the nickname the user wants to have in it. So our 'publisher1' user would write TUTORIAL in \"Session\" field:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe form will execute a POST operation to path \n/session\n whenever \"Join!\" button is clicked, passing the nickname and the session name:\n\n\nform class=\nform-group\n action=\n/session\n method=\npost\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nParticipant\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\ntext\n name=\ndata\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nSession\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\ntext\n name=\nsession-name\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np class=\ntext-center\n\n        \nbutton class=\nbtn btn-lg btn-success\n type=\nsubmit\nJoin!\n/button\n\n    \n/p\n\n\n/form\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \nSessionController.java\n receives a request at \n/session\n path is when things get interesting.\nFirst of all there are some important attributes in this class we must mention:\n\n\n// OpenVidu object to ask openvidu-server for sessionId and token\nprivate OpenVidu openVidu;\n\n// Collection to pair session names and OpenVidu Session objects\nprivate Map\nString, Session\n mapSessions = new ConcurrentHashMap\n();\n// Collection to pair sessionId's and tokens (the inner Map pairs tokens and role associated)\nprivate Map\nString, Map\nString, OpenViduRole\n mapSessionIdsTokens = new ConcurrentHashMap\n();\n\n// URL where our OpenVidu server is listening\nprivate String OPENVIDU_URL;\n// Secret shared with our OpenVidu server\nprivate String SECRET;\n\n\n\n\nRest controller method receives both params sent by the client (whatever nickname the user has chosen and \"TUTORIAL\" as the sessionName). First it prepares a param we will need a little further on: \ntokenOptions\n.\n\n\n@RequestMapping(value = \n/session\n, method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic String joinSession(@RequestParam(name = \ndata\n) String clientData,\n              @RequestParam(name = \nsession-name\n) String sessionName, \n              Model model, HttpSession httpSession) {\n    // Check the user is logged ... \n\n    // Role associated to this user\n    OpenViduRole role = LoginController.users.get(httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n)).role;\n\n    // Optional data to be passed to other users when this user connects to the video-call\n    // In this case, a JSON with the value we stored in the HttpSession object on login\n    String serverData = \n{\\\nserverData\\\n: \\\n + httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n) + \n\\\n}\n;\n\n    // Build tokenOptions object with the serverData and the role\n    TokenOptions tokenOptions = new TokenOptions.Builder().data(serverData).role(role).build();\n\n\n\n\nJust after that an \nif-else\n statement comes into play: does the session \"TUTORIAL\" already exist? \n\n\nif (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null) { ...\n\n\n\n\nIn this case it doesn't because 'publisher1' is the first user connecting to it. So we focus on the \nelse\n branch:\n\n\nelse {\n    // New session: return a new sessionId and a new token\n    try {\n\n        // Create a new OpenVidu Session\n        Session session = this.openVidu.createSession();\n        // Get the sessionId\n        String sessionId = session.getSessionId();\n        // Generate a new token with the recently created tokenOptions\n        String token = session.generateToken(tokenOptions);\n\n        // Store the session and the token in our collections\n        this.mapSessions.put(sessionName, session);\n        this.mapSessionIdsTokens.put(sessionId, new ConcurrentHashMap\n());\n        this.mapSessionIdsTokens.get(sessionId).put(token, role);\n\n        // Add all the needed attributes to the template\n        model.addAttribute(\nsessionId\n, sessionId);\n        model.addAttribute(\ntoken\n, token);\n        model.addAttribute(\nnickName\n, clientData);\n        model.addAttribute(\nuserName\n, httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n));\n        model.addAttribute(\nsessionName\n, sessionName);\n\n        // Return session.html template\n        return \nsession\n;\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // If error just return dashboard.html template\n        model.addAttribute(\nusername\n, httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n));\n        return \ndashboard\n;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe are almost there! Now in \nsession.html\n JavaScript code (preceded by a tag \nscript th:inline=\"javascript\"\n) we can init a new Session with \nsessionId\n and connect to it with \ntoken\n:\n\n\n// Get all the attributes from the template in Thymeleaf style\nvar sessionId = [[${sessionId}]];\nvar token = [[${token}]];\nvar nickName = [[${nickName}]];\nvar userName = [[${userName}]];\nvar sessionName = [[${sessionName}]];\n\n// --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object and init a session with the retrieved sessionId ---\n\nvar OV = new OpenVidu();\nvar session = OV.initSession(sessionId);\n\n\n// --- 2) Specify the actions when events take place ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nsession.on('streamCreated', function (event) {\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it\n    // HTML video will be appended to element with 'video-container' id\n    var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'video-container');\n\n    // When the HTML video has been appended to DOM...\n    subscriber.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {\n\n        // Add a new HTML element for the user's name and nickname over its video\n        appendUserData(event.element, subscriber.stream.connection);\n    });\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nsession.on('streamDestroyed', function (event) {\n    // Delete the HTML element with the user's name and nickname\n    removeUserData(event.stream.connection);\n});\n\n\n// --- 3) Connect to the session passing the retrieved token and some more data from\n//         the client (in this case a JSON with the nickname chosen by the user) ---\nsession.connect(token, '{\nclientData\n: \n' + nickName + '\n}', function (error) {\n\n    // If the connection is successful, initialize a publisher and publish to the session\n    if (!error) {\n\n        // Here we check somehow if the user has at least 'PUBLISHER' role before\n        // trying to publish its stream. Even if someone modified the client's code and\n        // published the stream, it wouldn't work if the token sent in Session.connect\n        // method doesn't belong to a 'PUBLIHSER' role\n        if (isPublisher()) {\n\n            // --- 4) Get your own camera stream ---\n\n            var publisher = OV.initPublisher('video-container', {\n                audio: true,\n                video: true,\n                quality: 'MEDIUM'\n            });\n\n            // When our HTML video has been added to DOM...\n            publisher.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {\n                // Init the main video with ours and append our data\n                var userData = {\n                    nickName: nickName,\n                    userName: userName\n                };\n                initMainVideo(event.element, userData);\n                appendUserData(event.element, userData);\n                $(event.element).prop('muted', true);  // Mute local video\n            });\n\n\n            // --- 5) Publish your stream ---\n\n            session.publish(publisher);\n\n        } else {\n            console.warn('You don\\'t have permissions to publish');\n            initMainVideoThumbnail(); // Show SUBSCRIBER message in main video\n        }\n    } else {\n        console.warn('There was an error connecting to the session:', error.code, error.message);\n    }\n});\n\n\n\n\nThe user will now see its own video on the page. The connection to the session has completed!\n\n\n\n\n3) Another user connects to the video-call\n\n\nThe process would be exactly the same as before until \nSessionController.java\n executes \ngetSessionIdAndToken()\n method. Now session 'TUTORIAL' already exists, so in the \nif-else\n statement the \nif\n branch would be the one executed:\n\n\nif (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null) {\n    // Session already exists: return existing sessionId and a new token\n    try {\n\n        // Get the existing sessionId from our collection with \n        // the sessionName param (\nTUTORIAL\n)\n        String sessionId = this.mapSessions.get(sessionName).getSessionId();\n        // Generate a new token with the recently created tokenOptions\n        String token = this.mapSessions.get(sessionName).generateToken(tokenOptions);\n\n        // Update our collection storing the new token\n        this.mapSessionIdsTokens.get(sessionId).put(token, role);\n\n        // Add all the needed attributes to the template\n        model.addAttribute(\nsessionId\n, sessionId);\n        model.addAttribute(\ntoken\n, token);\n        model.addAttribute(\nnickName\n, clientData);\n        model.addAttribute(\nuserName\n, httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n));\n        model.addAttribute(\nsessionName\n, sessionName);\n\n        // Return session.html template\n        return \nsession\n;\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // If error just return dashboard.html template\n        model.addAttribute(\nusername\n, httpSession.getAttribute(\nloggedUser\n));\n        return \ndashboard\n;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe code executed in \nsession.html\n \n script \n tag would also be the same. After the \nSession.publish()\n method has been succesful, both users will be seeing each other's video, as well as the username and the nickname below it.\n\n\n\n\n4) Users leave the video-call\n\n\nAfter a while both users decide to leave the session. Apart from calling \nsession.disconnect()\n (triggered in \nleaveSession()\n \nonclick\n method) to destroy the connection on openvidu-server, we need another POST operation to let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens.\n\n\nIn \nsession.html\n template the \"Leave session\" button actually performs a POST operation to path \n/leave-session\n with a hidden form. Notice that when the user clicks the submit button, a POST operation will be triggered but also the \nleaveSession()\n method. First updates our backend. Second updates our openvidu-server.\n\n\nform action=\n/leave-session\n method=\npost\n\n    \ninput type=\nhidden\n name=\nsession-name\n th:value=\n${sessionName}\n/input\n\n    \ninput type=\nhidden\n name=\ntoken\n th:value=\n${token}\n/input\n\n    \nbutton id=\nbuttonLeaveSession\n class=\nbtn btn-large btn-danger\n type=\nsubmit\n onclick=\nleaveSession()\n\n        Leave session\n/button\n\n\n/form\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \nSessionController.java\n we update the collections:\n\n\n@RequestMapping(value = \n/leave-session\n, method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic String removeUser(@RequestParam(name = \nsession-name\n) String sessionName,\n             @RequestParam(name = \ntoken\n) String token,\n             Model model, HttpSession httpSession) throws Exception {\n    // Check the user is logged ... \n\n    // If the session exists (\nTUTORIAL\n in this case)\n    if (this.mapSessions.get(sessionName) != null) {\n        String sessionId = this.mapSessions.get(sessionName).getSessionId();\n\n        if (this.mapSessionIdsTokens.containsKey(sessionId)) {\n            // If the token exists\n            if (this.mapSessionIdsTokens.get(sessionId).remove(token) != null) {\n                // User left the session\n                if (this.mapSessionIdsTokens.get(sessionId).isEmpty()) {\n                    // Last user left: session \nTUTORIAL\n must be removed\n                    this.mapSessions.remove(sessionName);\n                }\n                return \nredirect:/dashboard\n;\n            } else {\n                // The TOKEN wasn't valid\n                return \nredirect:/dashboard\n;\n            }\n        } else {\n            // The SESSIONID wasn't valid\n            return \nredirect:/dashboard\n;\n        }\n    } else {\n        // The SESSION does not exist\n        return \nredirect:/dashboard\n;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen the last user leaves the session \nthis.mapSessions.remove(sessionName);\n will be executed: this means the session is empty and that it is going to be closed. The \nsessionId\n and all \ntoken\n params associated to it will be invalidated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point we have covered all the important code from the tutorial. With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches: \nyou can implement your frontend and your backend as you want\n. \n\n\nThe only actual requirements are getting \nsessionId\n and \ntoken\n params from  \nopenvidu-server\n (by using one of the available clients or with the REST API) and using them along with \nopenvidu-browser\n to connect your clients to the sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

So we focus on the  else  branch:  else {\n    // New session: return a new sessionId and a new token\n    try {\n\n        // Create a new OpenVidu Session\n        Session session = this.openVidu.createSession();\n        // Get the sessionId\n        String sessionId = session.getSessionId();\n        // Generate a new token with the recently created tokenOptions\n        String token = session.generateToken(tokenOptions);\n\n        // Store the session and the token in our collections\n        this.mapSessions.put(sessionName, session);\n        this.mapSessionIdsTokens.put(sessionId, new ConcurrentHashMap ());\n        this.mapSessionIdsTokens.get(sessionId).put(token, role);\n\n        // Add all the needed attributes to the template\n        model.addAttribute( sessionId , sessionId);\n        model.addAttribute( token , token);\n        model.addAttribute( nickName , clientData);\n        model.addAttribute( userName , httpSession.getAttribute( loggedUser ));\n        model.addAttribute( sessionName , sessionName);\n\n        // Return session.html template\n        return  session ;\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        // If error just return dashboard.html template\n        model.addAttribute( username , httpSession.getAttribute( loggedUser ));\n        return  dashboard ;\n    }\n}  We are almost there! Now in  session.html  JavaScript code (preceded by a tag  script th:inline=\"javascript\" ) we can init a new Session with  sessionId  and connect to it with  token :  // Get all the attributes from the template in Thymeleaf style\nvar sessionId = [[${sessionId}]];\nvar token = [[${token}]];\nvar nickName = [[${nickName}]];\nvar userName = [[${userName}]];\nvar sessionName = [[${sessionName}]];\n\n// --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object and init a session with the retrieved sessionId ---\n\nvar OV = new OpenVidu();\nvar session = OV.initSession(sessionId);\n\n\n// --- 2) Specify the actions when events take place ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nsession.on('streamCreated', function (event) {\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it\n    // HTML video will be appended to element with 'video-container' id\n    var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'video-container');\n\n    // When the HTML video has been appended to DOM...\n    subscriber.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {\n\n        // Add a new HTML element for the user's name and nickname over its video\n        appendUserData(event.element, subscriber.stream.connection);\n    });\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nsession.on('streamDestroyed', function (event) {\n    // Delete the HTML element with the user's name and nickname\n    removeUserData(event.stream.connection);\n});\n\n\n// --- 3) Connect to the session passing the retrieved token and some more data from\n//         the client (in this case a JSON with the nickname chosen by the user) ---\nsession.connect(token, '{ clientData :  ' + nickName + ' }', function (error) {\n\n    // If the connection is successful, initialize a publisher and publish to the session\n    if (!error) {\n\n        // Here we check somehow if the user has at least 'PUBLISHER' role before\n        // trying to publish its stream.

Apart from calling  session.disconnect()  (triggered in  leaveSession()   onclick  method) to destroy the connection on openvidu-server, we need another POST operation to let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens.  In  session.html  template the \"Leave session\" button actually performs a POST operation to path  /leave-session  with a hidden form.

With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches:  you can implement your frontend and your backend as you want .   The only actual requirements are getting  sessionId  and  token  params from   openvidu-server  (by using one of the available clients or with the REST API) and using them along with  openvidu-browser  to connect your clients to the sessions.     \n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

It makes use of the \nopenvidu-node-client\n to get the necessary params from OpenVidu Server.\n\n\nUnderstanding this tutorial\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu is composed by the modules displayed on the image above.\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-browser\n: JavaScript library for the browser. It allows you to manage your video-calls straight away from your clients\n\n\nopenvidu-node-client\n: NPM package to easily get the necessary params (sessionId's and tokens) from openvidu-server. Quick alternative to REST API\n\n\nopenvidu-server\n: Java application that controls Kurento Media Server\n\n\nKurento Media Server\n: server that handles low level operations of media flow transmissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will only have to make use of \nopenvidu-browser\n and \nopenvidu-node-client\n to get this sample app working\n\n\n\n\nRunning this tutorial\n\n\n1) Clone the repo and checkout to version v1.1.0:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/OpenVidu/openvidu-tutorials.git\ncd openvidu-tutorials \n git checkout v1.1.0\n\n\n\n\n2) You will need \nnode\n to execute the app. You can install them with:\n\n\nsudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\n\n\n3) Run the tutorial with the following commands. They will install the NPM dependencies and will execute \nserver.js\n server passing two arguments: \"localhost:8443\" as the URL where \nopenvidu-server\n will be listening and \"MY_SECRET\" as the secret share with it:\n\n\ncd openvidu-js-node\nnpm install\nnode server.js localhost:8443 MY_SECRET\n\n\n\n\n4) \nopenvidu-server\n and \nKurento Media Server\n must be up and running in your development machine. The easiest way is running this Docker container which wraps both of them (you will need \nDocker CE\n):\n\n\ndocker run -p 8443:8443 --rm -e KMS_STUN_IP=stun.l.google.com -e KMS_STUN_PORT=19302 -e openvidu.secret=MY_SECRET openvidu/openvidu-server-kms:1.1.0\n\n\n\n\n5) Go to \nhttps://localhost:5000\n to test the app once the server is running. The first time you use the docker container, an alert message will suggest you accept the self-signed certificate of \nopenvidu-server\n when you first try to join a video-call. To test two users in the same computer, use a standard window and an incognito window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn \nsome tips\n to develop with OpenVidu, check this \nFAQ\n\n\nIf you are using \nWindows\n, read this \nFAQ\n to properly run the tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the code\n\n\nThis is a very basic web application with a pretty simple JS/HTML/CSS frontend and a straightforward Node backend with \nexpress\n. OpenVidu assumes you can identify your users so you can tell which users can connect to which video-calls, and what role (and therefore what permissions) each one of them will have in the calls. You can do this as you prefer. Here our backend will manage the users and their sessions with the easy-to-use and non-intrusive \nexpress-session\n API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackend\n: node server\n\n\n\n\nserver.js\n : single file which handles all operations of server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend\n: Pure JS/HTML/CSS files (\n/public\n folder)\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n : openvidu-browser library. You don't have to manipulate this file. \n\n\napp.js\n : sample application main JavaScritp file, which makes use of \nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n.\n\n\n\n\nindex.html\n : HTML code for the form to login, the form to connect to a video-call and for the video-call itself. It has two links to both JavaScript files:\n\n\nscript src=\"openvidu-browser-VERSION.js\"\n/script\n\n\nscript src=\"app.js\"\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstyle.css\n: some CSS classes to style \nindex.html\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's describe the code following this scenario: a user logs in to the app and connects to the video-call \"TUTORIAL\", where he publishes his webcam. A second user will connect to the same video-call just after that and publish its own webcam. Both of them will leave the call after a while.\n\n\n\n\n1) User logs in\n\n\nWe have implemented a method for making HTTP requests to the backend, as we will need to    make at least three of them: one for logging in, one for getting the sessionId and a valid token from openvidu-server and one for letting know our backend when any user leaves the video-call. The header of the method looks like this:\n\n\nfunction httpRequest(method, url, body, errorMsg, callback)\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nmethod\n is whether \"POST\" or \"GET\", \nurl\n the path of the REST operation, \nbody\n the data to be passed, \nerrorMsg\n the output error message if something goes wrong and \ncallback\n the function to execute in case of success. As mentioned above, we need to call this method three times for each user that LOGS IN \ud83e\udc52 CONNECTS TO A VIDEO-CALL \ud83e\udc52 LEAVES THE VIDEO-CALL.\n\n\nindex.html\n will first show a form to log in:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\napp.js\n sends an HTTP request to \"/api-login/login\" passing the username and the password retrieved from the HTML form whenever \"Log in\" button is clicked:\n\n\nfunction logIn() {\n    var user = $(\n#user\n).val(); // Username\n    var pass = $(\n#pass\n).val(); // Password\n    var jsonBody = JSON.stringify({ // Body of POST request\n        'user': user,\n        'pass': pass\n    });\n\n    httpRequest('POST', '/api-login/login', jsonBody, 'Login WRONG',\n      function successCallback(response){ // Send POST request\n        // HTML shows logged-in page ...\n    });\n}\n\n\n\n\nserver.js\n at \n/api-login/login\n checks the params are correct and if so sets an active session for the newly logged user (adding a \nloggedUser\n property with its username in the \nreq.session\n object):\n\n\napp.post('/api-login/login', function (req, res) {\n\n    // Retrieve params from POST body\n    var user = req.body.user;\n    var pass = req.body.pass;\n\n    if (login(user, pass)) { // Correct user-pass\n        // Validate session and return OK \n        // Value stored in req.session allows us to identify the user in future requests\n        req.session.loggedUser = user;\n        res.status(200).send();\n    } else { // Wrong user-pass\n        // Invalidate session and return error\n        req.session.destroy();\n        res.status(401).send('User/Pass incorrect');\n    }\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) User connects to \"TUTORIAL\" video-call\n\n\nHTML will display now the user has logged a different form, asking for the video-call to connect and the nickname the user wants to have in it. So our 'publisher1' user would write TUTORIAL in \"Session\" field and press \"Join!\" button:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\napp.js\n will execute \njoinSession()\n method, which starts like this:\n\n\nfunction joinSession() {\n    getSessionIdAndToken(function () { ...\n\n\n\n\nSo the first thing to do here is to retrieve a \nsessionId\n and a \ntoken\n from our backend. Only when we have them available in the browser we will continue with the \njoin\n operation. Let's see what \ngetSessionIdAndToken()\n looks like:\n\n\nfunction getSessionIdAndToken(callback) {\n    sessionName = $(\n#sessionName\n).val(); // Video-call chosen by the user (\nTUTORIAL\n)\n    nickName = $(\n#participantName\n).val(); // Nickname chosen by the user\n    var jsonBody = JSON.stringify({ // Body of POST request\n        'session': sessionName\n    });\n\n    // Send POST request\n    httpRequest('POST', '/api-sessions/get-sessionid-token', jsonBody, \n     'Request of SESSIONID and TOKEN gone WRONG:', function successCallback(response){\n        sessionId = response[0]; // Get sessionId from response\n        token = response[1]; // Get token from response\n        callback(); // Continue the join operation\n    });\n}\n\n\n\n\nHere is the second time we must call our \nhttpRequest()\n method, sending the session we want to connect (\"TUTORIAL\") and waiting to get a \nsessionId\n and a \ntoken\n as response. The interesting part here is in \nserver.js\n controller at \n/api-sessions/get-sessionid-token\n. First of all there are some important attributes in this class we must mention:\n\n\n// Environment variable: URL where our OpenVidu server is listening\nvar OPENVIDU_URL = process.argv[2];\n// Environment variable: secret shared with our OpenVidu server\nvar OPENVIDU_SECRET = process.argv[3];\n\n// OpenVidu object to ask openvidu-server for sessionId and token\nvar OV = new OpenVidu(OPENVIDU_URL, OPENVIDU_SECRET);\n\n// Collection to pair session names and OpenVidu Session objects\nvar mapSessionNameSession = {};\n// Collection to pair sessionId's (identifiers of Session objects) and tokens\nvar mapSessionIdTokens = {};\n\n\n\n\nRest controller method begins retrieving the param send by the client, which in this case is the video-call name (\"TUTORIAL\"), as well as preparing a param we will need a little further on: \ntokenOptions\n.\n\n\napp.post('/api-sessions/get-sessionid-token', function (req, res) {\n    // Check the user is logged ... \n\n    // The video-call to connect (\nTUTORIAL\n)\n    var sessionName = req.body.session;\n\n    // Role associated to this user\n    var role = users.find(u =\n (u.user === req.session.loggedUser)).role;\n\n    // Optional data to be passed to other users when this user connects to the video-call\n    // In this case, a JSON with the value we stored in the req.session object on login\n    var serverData = '{\nserverData\n: \n' + req.session.loggedUser + '\n}';\n\n    // Build tokenOptions object with the serverData and the role\n    var tokenOptions = new TokenOptions.Builder()\n        .data(serverData)\n        .role(role)\n        .build();\n\n\n\n\nJust after that an \nif-else\n statement comes into play: does the session \"TUTORIAL\" already exist? \n\n\nif (mapSessionNameSession[sessionName]) { ...\n\n\n\n\nIn this case it doesn't because 'publisher1' is the first user connecting to it. So we focus on the \nelse\n branch:\n\n\nelse { // New session: return a new sessionId and a new token\n\n    // Create a new OpenVidu Session\n    var mySession = OV.createSession();\n\n    // Get the sessionId asynchronously\n    mySession.getSessionId(function (sessionId) {\n\n        // Store the new Session in the collection of Sessions\n        mapSessionNameSession[sessionName] = mySession;\n        // Store a new empty array in the collection of tokens\n        mapSessionIdTokens[sessionId] = [];\n\n        // Generate a new token asynchronously with the recently created tokenOptions\n        mySession.generateToken(tokenOptions, function (token) {\n\n            // Store the new token in the collection of tokens\n            mapSessionIdTokens[sessionId].push(token);\n\n            // Return the sessionId and token to the client\n            res.status(200).send({\n                0: sessionId,\n                1: token\n            });\n        });\n    });\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe are almost there! Now in \napp.js\n we can init a new Session with \nsessionId\n and connect to it with \ntoken\n:\n\n\n// --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object and init a session with the retrieved sessionId ---\n\nOV = new OpenVidu();\nsession = OV.initSession(sessionId);\n\n\n// --- 2) Specify the actions when events take place ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nsession.on('streamCreated', function (event) {\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it\n    // HTML video will be appended to element with 'video-container' id\n    var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'video-container');\n\n    // When the HTML video has been appended to DOM...\n    subscriber.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {\n\n        // Add a new \np\n element for the user's name and nickname just below its video\n        appendUserData(event.element, subscriber.stream.connection);\n    });\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nsession.on('streamDestroyed', function (event) {\n    // Delete the HTML element with the user's name and nickname\n    removeUserData(event.stream.connection);\n});\n\n\n// --- 3) Connect to the session passing the retrieved token and some more data from\n//         the client (in this case a JSON with the nickname chosen by the user) ---\n\nsession.connect(token, '{\nclientData\n: \n' + nickName + '\n}', function (error) {\n\n    // If the connection is successful, initialize a publisher and publish to the session\n    if (!error) {\n\n        // Here we check somehow if the user has at least 'PUBLISHER' role before\n        // trying to publish its stream. Even if someone modified the client's code and\n        // published the stream, it wouldn't work if the token sent in Session.connect\n        // method doesn't belong to a 'PUBLIHSER' role\n        if (isPublisher()) {\n\n            // --- 4) Get your own camera stream ---\n\n            var publisher = OV.initPublisher('video-container', {\n                audio: true,\n                video: true,\n                quality: 'MEDIUM'\n            });\n\n            // When our HTML video has been added to DOM...\n            publisher.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {\n                // Init the main video with ours and append our data\n                var userData = {\n                    nickName: nickName,\n                    userName: userName\n                };\n                initMainVideo(event.element, userData);\n                appendUserData(event.element, userData);\n                $(event.element).prop('muted', true); // Mute lcoal video\n            });\n\n\n            // --- 5) Publish your stream ---\n\n            session.publish(publisher);\n\n        } else {\n            console.warn('You don\\'t have permissions to publish');\n            initMainVideoThumbnail(); // Show SUBSCRIBER message in main video\n        }\n    } else {\n        console.warn('There was an error connecting to the session:', error.code, error.message);\n    }\n});\n\n// HTML shows session page ...\n\n\n\n\nThe user will now see its own video on the page. The connection to the session has completed!\n\n\n\n\n3) Another user connects to the video-call\n\n\nThe process would be exactly the same as before until \nserver.js\n executes controller at \n/api-sessions/get-sessionid-token\n. Now session 'TUTORIAL' already exists, so in the \nif-else\n statement the \nif\n branch would be the one executed:\n\n\nif (mapSessionNameSession[sessionName]) {\n    // Session already exists: return existing sessionId and a new token\n\n    // Get the existing Session from the collection\n    var mySession = mapSessionNameSession[sessionName];\n\n    // Generate a new token asynchronously with the recently created tokenOptions\n    mySession.generateToken(tokenOptions, function (token) {\n\n        // Get the existing sessionId\n        mySession.getSessionId(function (sessionId) {\n\n            // Store the new token in the collection of tokens\n            mapSessionIdTokens[sessionId].push(token);\n\n            // Return the sessionId and token to the client\n            res.status(200).send({\n                0: sessionId,\n                1: token\n            });\n        });\n    });\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe code executed in \napp.js\n would also be the same. After the \nSession.publish()\n method has been succesful, both users will be seeing each other's video, as well as the username and the nickname below it.\n\n\n\n\n4) Users leave the video-call\n\n\nAfter a while both users decide to leave the session. Apart from calling \nleaveSession()\n (and therefore \nsession.disconnect()\n) to destroy the connection on openvidu-server, we need to run the last HTTP operation: we must let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens. To sum up, \nsession.disconnect()\n updates our openvidu-server and the POST operation updates our backend.\nFor the POST operation, in \napp.js\n we run:\n\n\nfunction removeUser() {\n    // Body of POST request with the name of the session and the token of the leaving user\n    var jsonBody = JSON.stringify({\n        'sessionName': sessionName,\n        'token': token\n    });\n\n    // Send POST request\n    httpRequest('POST', '/api-sessions/remove-user', jsonBody,\n        'User couldn\\'t be removed from session', function successCallback(response) {\n        console.warn(userName + ' correctly removed from session ' + sessionName);\n    });\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd in \nserver.js\n we update the collections in \n/api-sessions/remove-user\n:\n\n\napp.post('/api-sessions/remove-user', function (req, res) {\n    // Check the user is logged ...\n\n    // Retrieve params from POST body\n    var sessionName = req.body.sessionName;\n    var token = req.body.token;\n\n    // If the session exists\n    var mySession = mapSessionNameSession[sessionName];\n    if (mySession) {\n        mySession.getSessionId(function (sessionId) {\n            var tokens = mapSessionIdTokens[sessionId];\n            if (tokens) {\n                var index = tokens.indexOf(token);\n\n                // If the token exists\n                if (index !== -1) {\n                    // Token removed!\n                    tokens.splice(index, 1);\n                } else {\n                    var msg = 'Problems in the app server: the TOKEN wasn\\'t valid';\n                    res.status(500).send(msg);\n                }\n                if (mapSessionIdTokens[sessionId].length == 0) {\n                    // Last user left: session must be removed\n                    delete mapSessionNameSession[sessionName];\n                }\n                res.status(200).send();\n            } else {\n                var msg = 'Problems in the app server: the SESSIONID wasn\\'t valid';\n                res.status(500).send(msg);\n            }\n        });\n    } else {\n        var msg = 'Problems in the app server: the SESSION does not exist';\n        res.status(500).send(msg);\n    }\n\n\n\n\nWhen the last user leaves the session \ndelete mapSessionNameSession[sessionName]\n will be executed: this means the session is empty and that it is going to be closed. The \nsessionId\n and all \ntoken\n params associated to it will be invalidated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point we have covered all the important code from the tutorial. With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches: \nyou can implement your frontend and your backend as you want\n. \n\n\nThe only actual requirements are getting \nsessionId\n and \ntoken\n params from  \nopenvidu-server\n (by using one of the available clients or with the REST API) and using them along with \nopenvidu-browser\n to connect your clients to the sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

So the first thing to do here is to retrieve a  sessionId  and a  token  from our backend. Only when we have them available in the browser we will continue with the  join  operation.

The interesting part here is in  server.js  controller at  /api-sessions/get-sessionid-token . First of all there are some important attributes in this class we must mention:  // Environment variable: URL where our OpenVidu server is listening\nvar OPENVIDU_URL = process.argv[2];\n// Environment variable: secret shared with our OpenVidu server\nvar OPENVIDU_SECRET = process.argv[3];\n\n// OpenVidu object to ask openvidu-server for sessionId and token\nvar OV = new OpenVidu(OPENVIDU_URL, OPENVIDU_SECRET);\n\n// Collection to pair session names and OpenVidu Session objects\nvar mapSessionNameSession = {};\n// Collection to pair sessionId's (identifiers of Session objects) and tokens\nvar mapSessionIdTokens = {};  Rest controller method begins retrieving the param send by the client, which in this case is the video-call name (\"TUTORIAL\"), as well as preparing a param we will need a little further on:  tokenOptions .  app.post('/api-sessions/get-sessionid-token', function (req, res) {\n    // Check the user is logged ... \n\n    // The video-call to connect ( TUTORIAL )\n    var sessionName = req.body.session;\n\n    // Role associated to this user\n    var role = users.find(u =  (u.user === req.session.loggedUser)).role;\n\n    // Optional data to be passed to other users when this user connects to the video-call\n    // In this case, a JSON with the value we stored in the req.session object on login\n    var serverData = '{ serverData :  ' + req.session.loggedUser + ' }';\n\n    // Build tokenOptions object with the serverData and the role\n    var tokenOptions = new TokenOptions.Builder()\n        .data(serverData)\n        .role(role)\n        .build();  Just after that an  if-else  statement comes into play: does the session \"TUTORIAL\" already exist?   if (mapSessionNameSession[sessionName]) { ...  In this case it doesn't because 'publisher1' is the first user connecting to it. So we focus on the  else  branch:  else { // New session: return a new sessionId and a new token\n\n    // Create a new OpenVidu Session\n    var mySession = OV.createSession();\n\n    // Get the sessionId asynchronously\n    mySession.getSessionId(function (sessionId) {\n\n        // Store the new Session in the collection of Sessions\n        mapSessionNameSession[sessionName] = mySession;\n        // Store a new empty array in the collection of tokens\n        mapSessionIdTokens[sessionId] = [];\n\n        // Generate a new token asynchronously with the recently created tokenOptions\n        mySession.generateToken(tokenOptions, function (token) {\n\n            // Store the new token in the collection of tokens\n            mapSessionIdTokens[sessionId].push(token);\n\n            // Return the sessionId and token to the client\n            res.status(200).send({\n                0: sessionId,\n                1: token\n            });\n        });\n    });\n}  We are almost there!

            "text": "After a while both users decide to leave the session. Apart from calling  leaveSession()  (and therefore  session.disconnect() ) to destroy the connection on openvidu-server, we need to run the last HTTP operation: we must let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens. To sum up,  session.disconnect()  updates our openvidu-server and the POST operation updates our backend.\nFor the POST operation, in  app.js  we run:  function removeUser() {\n    // Body of POST request with the name of the session and the token of the leaving user\n    var jsonBody = JSON.stringify({\n        'sessionName': sessionName,\n        'token': token\n    });\n\n    // Send POST request\n    httpRequest('POST', '/api-sessions/remove-user', jsonBody,\n        'User couldn\\'t be removed from session', function successCallback(response) {\n        console.warn(userName + ' correctly removed from session ' + sessionName);\n    });\n}  And in  server.js  we update the collections in  /api-sessions/remove-user :  app.post('/api-sessions/remove-user', function (req, res) {\n    // Check the user is logged ...\n\n    // Retrieve params from POST body\n    var sessionName = req.body.sessionName;\n    var token = req.body.token;\n\n    // If the session exists\n    var mySession = mapSessionNameSession[sessionName];\n    if (mySession) {\n        mySession.getSessionId(function (sessionId) {\n            var tokens = mapSessionIdTokens[sessionId];\n            if (tokens) {\n                var index = tokens.indexOf(token);\n\n                // If the token exists\n                if (index !== -1) {\n                    // Token removed!\n                    tokens.splice(index, 1);\n                } else {\n                    var msg = 'Problems in the app server: the TOKEN wasn\\'t valid';\n                    res.status(500).send(msg);\n                }\n                if (mapSessionIdTokens[sessionId].length == 0) {\n                    // Last user left: session must be removed\n                    delete mapSessionNameSession[sessionName];\n                }\n                res.status(200).send();\n            } else {\n                var msg = 'Problems in the app server: the SESSIONID wasn\\'t valid';\n                res.status(500).send(msg);\n            }\n        });\n    } else {\n        var msg = 'Problems in the app server: the SESSION does not exist';\n        res.status(500).send(msg);\n    }  When the last user leaves the session  delete mapSessionNameSession[sessionName]  will be executed: this means the session is empty and that it is going to be closed. The  sessionId  and all  token  params associated to it will be invalidated.    At this point we have covered all the important code from the tutorial. With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches:  you can implement your frontend and your backend as you want .   The only actual requirements are getting  sessionId  and  token  params from   openvidu-server  (by using one of the available clients or with the REST API) and using them along with  openvidu-browser  to connect your clients to the sessions.     \n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

            "text": "openvidu-mvc-node\n\n\n Check it on GitHub\n\n\nA secure OpenVidu sample app with a Node backend and a traditional MVC frontend. With regard to the use of OpenVidu, it is identical to \nopenvidu-js-node\n. This tutorial is intended for developers who feel more comfortable with MVC web architectures for their frontends. \nEmbedded JavaScript\n is the template engine of choice for this tutorial.\n\n\nUnderstanding this tutorial\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu is composed by the modules displayed on the image above.\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-browser\n: JavaScript library for the browser. It allows you to manage your video-calls straight away from your clients\n\n\nopenvidu-node-client\n: NPM package to easily get the necessary params (sessionId's and tokens) from openvidu-server. Quick alternative to REST API\n\n\nopenvidu-server\n: Java application that controls Kurento Media Server\n\n\nKurento Media Server\n: server that handles low level operations of media flow transmissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will only have to make use of \nopenvidu-browser\n and \nopenvidu-node-client\n to get this sample app working\n\n\n\n\nRunning this tutorial\n\n\n1) Clone the repo and checkout to version v1.1.0:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/OpenVidu/openvidu-tutorials.git\ncd openvidu-tutorials \n git checkout v1.1.0\n\n\n\n\n2) You will need \nnode\n and \nNPM\n to execute the app. You can install them with:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install nodejs\nsudo apt-get install npm\n\n\n\n\n3) Run the tutorial with the following commands. They will install the NPM dependencies and will execute \nserver.js\n server passing two arguments: \"localhost:8443\" as the URL where \nopenvidu-server\n will be listening and \"MY_SECRET\" as the secret share with it:\n\n\ncd openvidu-mvc-node\nnpm install\nnode server.js localhost:8443 MY_SECRET\n\n\n\n\n4) \nopenvidu-server\n and \nKurento Media Server\n must be up and running in your development machine. The easiest way is running this Docker container which wraps both of them (you will need \nDocker CE\n):\n\n\ndocker run -p 8443:8443 --rm -e KMS_STUN_IP=stun.l.google.com -e KMS_STUN_PORT=19302 -e openvidu.secret=MY_SECRET openvidu/openvidu-server-kms:1.1.0\n\n\n\n\n5) Go to \nhttps://localhost:5000\n to test the app once the server is running. The first time you use the docker container, an alert message will suggest you accept the self-signed certificate of \nopenvidu-server\n when you first try to join a video-call. To test two users in the same computer, use a standard window and an incognito window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn \nsome tips\n to develop with OpenVidu, check this \nFAQ\n\n\nIf you are using \nWindows\n, read this \nFAQ\n to properly run the tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the code\n\n\nThis is a very basic web application with a pretty simple JS/HTML/CSS frontend and a straightforward Node backend built with \nexpress\n that serves HTML files with a MVC approach, building the templates with the help of \nEmbedded JavaScript\n.\n\n\nOpenVidu assumes you can identify your users so you can tell which users can connect to which video-calls, and what role (and therefore what permissions) each one of them will have in the calls. You can do this as you prefer. Here our backend will manage the users and their sessions with the easy-to-use and non-intrusive \nexpress-session\n API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackend\n: node server\n\n\n\n\nserver.js\n : single file which handles all operations of server. It returns HTML templates as response to HTTP requests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend templates\n: Pure JS/HTML/CSS files served by the backend, with \n.ejs\n extension to support Embedded JavaScript (\n/views\n folder)\n\n\n\n\nindex.ejs\n : template with the login form\n\n\ndashboard.ejs\n : template with the form to join a video-call\n\n\nsession.ejs\n : template of the video-call itself\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontend static files\n (\n/public\n folder)\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu-browser-VERSION.js\n : openvidu-browser library. You don't have to manipulate this file\n\n\nstyle.css\n : some CSS classes to style the templates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's describe the code following this scenario: a user logs in to the app and connects to the video-call \"TUTORIAL\", where he publishes his webcam. A second user will connect to the same video-call just after that and publish its own webcam. Both of them will leave the call after a while.\n\n\n\n\n1) User logs in\n\n\nAt path \n/\n a login form will be displayed:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe form will execute a POST operation to path \n/dashboard\n whenever \"Log in\" button is clicked, passing the username and the password:\n\n\nform class=\nform-group jumbotron\n action=\n/dashboard\n method=\npost\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nUser\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\ntext\n name=\nuser\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nPass\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\npassword\n name=\npass\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np class=\ntext-center\n\n        \nbutton class=\nbtn btn-lg btn-info\n type=\nsubmit\nLog in\n/button\n\n    \n/p\n\n\n/form\n\n\n\n\n\nserver.js\n at \n/dashboard\n first checks if the user is already logged (maybe he has just refreshed \n/dashboard\n page), and if so it just redirects to the dashboard itself. If the user is actually logging in, the method checks that the params are correct and if so sets a new \nexpress-session\n for the newly logged user (adding a \nloggedUser\n property with its username in the \nreq.session\n object). Finally it returns \ndashboard.ejs\n template:\n\n\napp.post('/dashboard', dashboardController);\napp.get('/dashboard', dashboardController);\n\nfunction dashboardController(req, res) {\n\n    // Check if the user is already logged in\n    if (isLogged(req.session)) {\n        // User is already logged. Immediately return dashboard\n        user = req.session.loggedUser;\n        res.render('dashboard.ejs', {\n            user: user\n        });\n    } else {\n        // User wasn't logged and wants to\n\n        // Retrieve params from POST body\n        var user = req.body.user;\n        var pass = req.body.pass;\n\n        if (login(user, pass)) { // Correct user-pass\n            // Validate session and return OK \n            // Value stored in req.session allows us to identify the user in future requests\n            req.session.loggedUser = user;\n            res.render('dashboard.ejs', {\n                user: user\n            });\n        } else { // Wrong user-pass\n            // Invalidate session and return index template\n            req.session.destroy();\n            res.redirect('/');\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) User connects to \"TUTORIAL\" video-call\n\n\ndashboard.ejs\n template will display a form asking for the video-call to connect and the nickname the user wants to have in it. So our 'publisher1' user would write TUTORIAL in \"Session\" field:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe form will execute a POST operation to path \n/session\n whenever \"Join!\" button is clicked, passing the nickname and the session name:\n\n\nform class=\nform-group\n action=\n/session\n method=\npost\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nParticipant\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\ntext\n name=\ndata\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np\n\n        \nlabel\nSession\n/label\n\n        \ninput class=\nform-control\n type=\ntext\n name=\nsessionname\n required=\ntrue\n/input\n\n    \n/p\n\n    \np class=\ntext-center\n\n        \nbutton class=\nbtn btn-lg btn-success\n type=\nsubmit\nJoin!\n/button\n\n    \n/p\n\n\n/form\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \nserver.js\n receives a request at \n/session\n path is when things get interesting.\nFirst of all there are some important attributes in this class we must mention:\n\n\n// Environment variable: URL where our OpenVidu server is listening\nvar OPENVIDU_URL = process.argv[2];\n// Environment variable: secret shared with our OpenVidu server\nvar OPENVIDU_SECRET = process.argv[3];\n\n// OpenVidu object to ask openvidu-server for sessionId and token\nvar OV = new OpenVidu(OPENVIDU_URL, OPENVIDU_SECRET);\n\n// Collection to pair session names and OpenVidu Session objects\nvar mapSessionNameSession = {};\n// Collection to pair sessionId's (identifiers of Session objects) and tokens\nvar mapSessionIdTokens = {};\n\n\n\n\nRest controller method receives both params sent by the client (whatever nickname the user has chosen and \"TUTORIAL\" as the sessionName). First it prepares a param we will need a little further on: \ntokenOptions\n.\n\n\napp.post('/session', (req, res) =\n {\n    // Check the user is logged ... \n\n    // The nickname sent by the client\n    var clientData = req.body.data;\n    // The video-call to connect (\nTUTORIAL\n)\n    var sessionName = req.body.sessionname;\n\n    // Role associated to this user\n    var role = users.find(u =\n (u.user === req.session.loggedUser)).role;\n\n    // Optional data to be passed to other users when this user connects to the video-call\n    // In this case, a JSON with the value we stored in the req.session object on login\n    var serverData = '{\nserverData\n: \n' + req.session.loggedUser + '\n}';\n\n    // Build tokenOptions object with the serverData and the role\n    var tokenOptions = new TokenOptions.Builder()\n        .data(serverData)\n        .role(role)\n        .build();\n\n\n\n\nJust after that an \nif-else\n statement comes into play: does the session \"TUTORIAL\" already exist? \n\n\nif (mapSessionNameSession[sessionName]) { ...\n\n\n\n\nIn this case it doesn't because 'publisher1' is the first user connecting to it. So we focus on the \nelse\n branch:\n\n\nelse { // New session: return a new sessionId and a new token\n\n    // Create a new OpenVidu Session\n    var mySession = OV.createSession();\n\n    // Get the sessionId asynchronously\n    mySession.getSessionId(function (sessionId) {\n\n        // Store the new Session in the collection of Sessions\n        mapSessionNameSession[sessionName] = mySession;\n        // Store a new empty array in the collection of tokens\n        mapSessionIdTokens[sessionId] = [];\n\n        // Generate a new token asynchronously with the recently created tokenOptions\n        mySession.generateToken(tokenOptions, function (token) {\n\n            // Store the new token in the collection of tokens\n            mapSessionIdTokens[sessionId].push(token);\n\n            // Return session template with all the needed attributes\n            res.render('session.ejs', {\n                sessionId: sessionId,\n                token: token,\n                nickName: clientData,\n                userName: req.session.loggedUser,\n                sessionName: sessionName\n            });\n        });\n    });\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe are almost there! Now in \nsession.ejs\n JavaScript code (preceded by a tag \nscript\n) we can init a new Session with \nsessionId\n and connect to it with \ntoken\n:\n\n\n// Get all the attributes from the template in EJS style\nvar sessionId = \n%- JSON.stringify(sessionId) %\n;\nvar token = \n%- JSON.stringify(token) %\n;\nvar nickName = \n%- JSON.stringify(nickName) %\n;\nvar userName = \n%- JSON.stringify(userName) %\n;\nvar sessionName = \n%- JSON.stringify(sessionName) %\n;\n\n\n\n\n// --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object and init a session with the retrieved sessionId ---\n\nvar OV = new OpenVidu();\nvar session = OV.initSession(sessionId);\n\n\n// --- 2) Specify the actions when events take place ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nsession.on('streamCreated', function (event) {\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it\n    // HTML video will be appended to element with 'video-container' id\n    var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'video-container');\n\n    // When the HTML video has been appended to DOM...\n    subscriber.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {\n\n        // Add a new HTML element for the user's name and nickname just below its video\n        appendUserData(event.element, subscriber.stream.connection);\n    });\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nsession.on('streamDestroyed', function (event) {\n    // Delete the HTML element with the user's name and nickname\n    removeUserData(event.stream.connection);\n});\n\n\n// --- 3) Connect to the session passing the retrieved token and some more data from\n//         the client (in this case a JSON with the nickname chosen by the user) ---\n\nsession.connect(token, '{\nclientData\n: \n' + nickName + '\n}', function (error) {\n\n    // If the connection is successful, initialize a publisher and publish to the session\n    if (!err) {\n\n        // Here we check somehow if the user has at least 'PUBLISHER' role before\n        // trying to publish its stream. Even if someone modified the client's code and\n        // published the stream, it wouldn't work if the token sent in Session.connect\n        // method doesn't belong to a 'PUBLIHSER' role\n        if (isPublisher()) {\n\n            // --- 4) Get your own camera stream ---\n\n            var publisher = OV.initPublisher('video-container', {\n                audio: true,\n                video: true,\n                quality: 'MEDIUM'\n            });\n\n            // When our HTML video has been added to DOM...\n            publisher.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {\n                // Init the main video with ours and append our data\n                var userData = {\n                    nickName: nickName,\n                    userName: userName\n                };\n                initMainVideo(event.element, userData);\n                appendUserData(event.element, userData);\n                $(event.element).prop('muted', true); // Mute local video\n            });\n\n\n            // --- 5) Publish your stream ---\n\n            session.publish(publisher);\n\n        } else {\n            console.warn('You don\\'t have permissions to publish');\n            initMainVideoThumbnail(); // Show SUBSCRIBER message in main video\n        }\n    } else {\n        console.warn('There was an error connecting to the session:', error.code, error.message);\n    }\n});\n\n\n\n\nThe user will now see its own video on the page. The connection to the session has completed!\n\n\n\n\n3) Another user connects to the video-call\n\n\nThe process would be exactly the same as before until \nserver.js\n executes controller at \n/api-sessions/get-sessionid-token\n. Now session 'TUTORIAL' already exists, so in the \nif-else\n statement the \nif\n branch would be the one executed:\n\n\nif (mapSessionNameSession[sessionName]) {\n    // Session already exists: return existing sessionId and a new token\n\n    // Get the existing Session from the collection\n    var mySession = mapSessionNameSession[sessionName];\n\n    // Generate a new token asynchronously with the recently created tokenOptions\n    mySession.generateToken(tokenOptions, function (token) {\n\n        // Get the existing sessionId\n        mySession.getSessionId(function (sessionId) {\n\n            // Store the new token in the collection of tokens\n            mapSessionIdTokens[sessionId].push(token);\n\n            // Return session template with all the needed attributes\n            res.render('session.ejs', {\n                sessionId: sessionId,\n                token: token,\n                nickName: clientData,\n                userName: req.session.loggedUser,\n                sessionName: sessionName\n            });\n        });\n    });\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe code executed in \nsession.ejs\n \n script \n tag would also be the same. After the \nSession.publish()\n method has been succesful, both users will be seeing each other's video, as well as the username and the nickname below it.\n\n\n\n\n4) Users leave the video-call\n\n\nAfter a while both users decide to leave the session. Apart from calling \nsession.disconnect()\n (triggered in \nleaveSession()\n \nonclick\n method) to destroy the connection on openvidu-server, we need another POST operation to let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens.\n\n\nIn \nsession.ejs\n template the \"Leave session\" button actually performs a POST operation to path \n/leave-session\n with a hidden form. Notice that when the user clicks the submit button, a POST operation will be triggered but also the \nleaveSession()\n method. First updates our backend. Second updates our openvidu-server.\n\n\nform action=\n/leave-session\n method=\npost\n\n    \ninput style=\ndisplay:none\n name=\nsessionname\n value=\n%= sessionName %\n/input\n\n    \ninput style=\ndisplay:none\n name=\ntoken\n value=\n%= token %\n/input\n\n    \nbutton id=\nbuttonLeaveSession\n class=\nbtn btn-large btn-danger\n type=\nsubmit\n onclick=\nleaveSession()\n\n        Leave session\n/button\n\n\n/form\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \nserver.js\n we update the collections at \n/leave-session\n:\n\n\napp.post('/leave-session', function (req, res) {\n    // Check the user is logged ...\n\n    // Retrieve params from POST body\n    var sessionName = req.body.sessionname;\n    var token = req.body.token;\n\n    // If the session exists\n    var mySession = mapSessionNameSession[sessionName];\n    if (mySession) {\n        mySession.getSessionId(function (sessionId) {\n            var tokens = mapSessionIdTokens[sessionId];\n            if (tokens) {\n                var index = tokens.indexOf(token);\n\n                // If the token exists\n                if (index !== -1) {\n                    // Token removed!\n                    tokens.splice(index, 1);\n                } else {\n                    var msg = 'Problems in the app server: the TOKEN wasn\\'t valid';\n                    res.redirect('/dashboard');\n                }\n                if (mapSessionIdTokens[sessionId].length == 0) {\n                    // Last user left: session must be removed\n                    console.log(sessionName + ' empty!');\n                    delete mapSessionNameSession[sessionName];\n                }\n                res.redirect('/dashboard');\n            } else {\n                var msg = 'Problems in the app server: the SESSIONID wasn\\'t valid';\n                res.redirect('/dashboard');\n            }\n        });\n    } else {\n        var msg = 'Problems in the app server: the SESSION does not exist';\n        res.redirect('/dashboard');\n    }\n\n\n\n\nWhen the last user leaves the session \ndelete mapSessionNameSession[sessionName]\n will be executed: this means the session is empty and that it is going to be closed. The \nsessionId\n and all \ntoken\n params associated to it will be invalidated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point we have covered all the important code from the tutorial. With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches: \nyou can implement your frontend and your backend as you want\n. \n\n\nThe only actual requirements are getting \nsessionId\n and \ntoken\n params from  \nopenvidu-server\n (by using one of the available clients or with the REST API) and using them along with \nopenvidu-browser\n to connect your clients to the sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

Now in  session.ejs  JavaScript code (preceded by a tag  script ) we can init a new Session with  sessionId  and connect to it with  token :  // Get all the attributes from the template in EJS style\nvar sessionId =  %- JSON.stringify(sessionId) % ;\nvar token =  %- JSON.stringify(token) % ;\nvar nickName =  %- JSON.stringify(nickName) % ;\nvar userName =  %- JSON.stringify(userName) % ;\nvar sessionName =  %- JSON.stringify(sessionName) % ;  // --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object and init a session with the retrieved sessionId ---\n\nvar OV = new OpenVidu();\nvar session = OV.initSession(sessionId);\n\n\n// --- 2) Specify the actions when events take place ---\n\n// On every new Stream received...\nsession.on('streamCreated', function (event) {\n\n    // Subscribe to the Stream to receive it\n    // HTML video will be appended to element with 'video-container' id\n    var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'video-container');\n\n    // When the HTML video has been appended to DOM...\n    subscriber.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {\n\n        // Add a new HTML element for the user's name and nickname just below its video\n        appendUserData(event.element, subscriber.stream.connection);\n    });\n});\n\n// On every Stream destroyed...\nsession.on('streamDestroyed', function (event) {\n    // Delete the HTML element with the user's name and nickname\n    removeUserData(event.stream.connection);\n});\n\n\n// --- 3) Connect to the session passing the retrieved token and some more data from\n//         the client (in this case a JSON with the nickname chosen by the user) ---\n\nsession.connect(token, '{ clientData :  ' + nickName + ' }', function (error) {\n\n    // If the connection is successful, initialize a publisher and publish to the session\n    if (!err) {\n\n        // Here we check somehow if the user has at least 'PUBLISHER' role before\n        // trying to publish its stream.

Apart from calling  session.disconnect()  (triggered in  leaveSession()   onclick  method) to destroy the connection on openvidu-server, we need another POST operation to let the backend know that certain user has left the session so it can update the collections with the active sessions and tokens.  In  session.ejs  template the \"Leave session\" button actually performs a POST operation to path  /leave-session  with a hidden form. Notice that when the user clicks the submit button, a POST operation will be triggered but also the  leaveSession()  method. First updates our backend.

The  sessionId  and all  token  params associated to it will be invalidated.    At this point we have covered all the important code from the tutorial. With this scenario we have seen the most common use-case, but you can modify whatever you want to suit your needs. And remember that this is just one of the many possible approaches:  you can implement your frontend and your backend as you want .   The only actual requirements are getting  sessionId  and  token  params from   openvidu-server  (by using one of the available clients or with the REST API) and using them along with  openvidu-browser  to connect your clients to the sessions.     \n  $().fancybox({\n    selector : '[data-fancybox=\"gallery\"]',\n    infobar : true,\n    arrows : false,\n    loop: true,\n    protect: true,\n    transitionEffect: 'slide',\n    buttons : [\n        'close'\n    ],\n    clickOutside : 'close',\n    clickSlide   : 'close',\n  });",

Connect to your EC2 instance through SSH\n\n\nRemember that the key will be the same you indicated when configuring the \nCloudFormation fields\n. In case of doubt, check \nAWS docs\n.\n\n\n3. Configure your app\n\n\nDepending on the framework of your app:\n\n\nPlain HTML/CSS/JS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd your web files into \n/opt/\n. You should have instant access to it through \nhttps://AMAZON_URL_OR_YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN/\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to test the deployment of a plain HTML/CSS/JS app, you can use \nopenvidu-insecure-js\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJava\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy your JAR or WAR into \n/opt/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a script to launch your app with all the parameters it needs, and store it under \n/opt/\n. For example, a file \n/opt/YOUR_LAUNCHER.sh\n containing:\n\n\ncd /opt\njava -jar -Dserver.port=4040 myapp.jar\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT 1\n: It is crucial to navigate to \n/opt\n before the launching command. Otherwise, the system will surely have some problems for finding your files\n\n\nIMPORTANT 2\n: Obviously your app will need Java to run. You must install the correct version of Java in your machine (check version: \njava -version\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Nginx: add a new \nlocation\n directive to the file \n/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n, inside the \nserver { }\n group:\n\n\n  location / {\n    rewrite /(.*) /$1 break;\n    proxy_pass https://localhost:PORT;\n  }\n\n\n\nFor example\n\n\n  location / {\n    rewrite /(.*) /$1 break;\n    proxy_pass https://localhost:4040;\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Supervisor: add the script you wrote in the second step to the file \n/etc/supervisor/conf.d/openvidu.conf\n like this:\n\n\n  [program:YOUR_APP]\n  command=/bin/bash /opt/YOUR_LAUNCHER.sh YOUR_APP_PARAM_1 YOUR_APP_PARAM_2 ...\n  redirect_stderr=true\n\n\n\n\n\nTo connect your Java app to OpenVidu Server in order to get your sessionIds and tokens (check \nSecurization\n section), you will need to use the URL \nhttps://localhost:8443\n. \nlocalhost\n because both your app and OpenVidu Server run in the same machine. \n8443\n because there's where OpenVidu Server listens for petitions. For example, our tutorial \nopenvidu-js-java\n sets this parameter as an environment variable \nright here\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart Nginx: \nsystemctl restart nginx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart Supervisor: \nsystemctl restart supervisor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will have access to your app through \nhttps://AMAZON_URL_OR_YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting: If your app is not working as expected, there are a few files you should check for debugging: \n/var/log/nginx/\n (info about the proxy), \n/var/log/supervisor/\n (output of your app). You can also try to connect to your app directly through the port like \nhttps://AMAZON_URL_OR_YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN:YOUR_APP_PORT\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to test the deployment of a Java app, you can use \nopenvidu-js-java\n or \nopenvidu-mvc-java\n (\nrelease here\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd your web files into \n/opt/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a script to launch your app with all the parameters it needs, and store it under \n/opt/\n. For example, a file \n/opt/YOUR_LAUNCHER.sh\n containing:\n\n\ncd /opt\nnode myserver.js 4040\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT 1\n: It is crucial to navigate to \n/opt\n before the launching command. Otherwise, the system will surely have some problems for finding your files\n\n\nIMPORTANT 2\n: Obviously your app will need Node to run. You must install the correct version of Node in your machine (check version: \nnodejs -v\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Nginx: add a new \nlocation\n directive to the file \n/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n, inside the \nserver { }\n group::\n\n\n  location / {\n    rewrite /(.*) /$1 break;\n    proxy_pass https://localhost:PORT;\n  }\n\n\n\nFor example\n\n\n  location / {\n    rewrite /(.*) /$1 break;\n    proxy_pass https://localhost:4040;\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart Nginx: \nsystemctl restart nginx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Supervisor: add the script you wrote in the second step to \n/etc/supervisor/conf.d/openvidu.conf\n like this:\n\n\n  [program:YOUR_APP]\n  command=/bin/bash /opt/YOUR_LAUNCHER.sh YOUR_APP_PARAM_1 YOUR_APP_PARAM_2 ...\n  redirect_stderr=true\n\n\n\n\n\nTo connect your Node app to OpenVidu Server in order to get your sessionIds and tokens (check \nSecurization\n section), you will need to use the URL \nhttps://localhost:8443\n. \nlocalhost\n because both your app and OpenVidu Server run in the same machine. \n8443\n because there's where OpenVidu Server listens for petitions. For example, our tutorial \nopenvidu-js-node\n expects this parameter as the first argument on launch command \nright here\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart Supervisor: \nsystemctl restart supervisor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will have access to your app through \nhttps://AMAZON_URL_OR_YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting: If your app is not working as expected, there are a few files you should check for debugging: \n/var/log/nginx/\n (info about the proxy), \n/var/log/supervisor/\n (output of your app). You can also try to connect to your app directly through the port like \nhttps://AMAZON_URL_OR_YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN:YOUR_APP_PORT\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to test the deployment of a Node app, you can use \nopenvidu-js-node\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHP, Ruby, Python, .NET...\n\n\nWe are not going to spell out in detail what is to be done with the rest of backend technologies, but you can get the idea from the Java and Node steps above. It is always the same process: take your app to your instance, place it under \n/opt/\n, configure Nginx and Supervisor (this last with the necessary launching script depending on your technology) and relaunch both services. Be sure that your machine has all the necessary dependencies and technologies to execute your application, depending on the framework (Java for a Java app, Node for a Node app, Ruby for a Ruby app...)\n\n\nVoil\u00e0! It is really this simple.\n\n\nPS: Multiple apps in the same instance\n\n\nTo launch multiple apps in the same instance, just store each one of them inside its own folder under \n/opt/\n. For example:\n\n\n\n\n/opt/YOUR_APP_1\n : will be available at \nhttps://AMAZON_URL_OR_YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN/YOUR_APP_1/\n\n\n/opt/YOUR_APP_2\n : will be available at \nhttps://AMAZON_URL_OR_YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN/YOUR_APP_2/\n\n\n\n\nThe other steps explained above also need some adjustments related to paths:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Nginx: now it would be...\n\n\nlocation /YOUR_APP_1 {\n  rewrite /YOUR_APP_1(.*) /$1 break;\n  proxy_pass https://localhost:PORT1;\n}\n\nlocation /YOUR_APP_2 {\n  rewrite /YOUR_APP_2(.*) /$1 break;\n  proxy_pass https://localhost:PORT2;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Supervisor: now...\n\n\n  [program:YOUR_APP_1]\n  command=/bin/bash /opt/YOUR_APP_1/YOUR_LAUNCHER_1.sh YOUR_APP1_PARAM_1 YOUR_APP1_PARAM_2 ...\n  redirect_stderr=true\n\n  [program:YOUR_APP_2]\n  command=/bin/bash /opt/YOUR_APP_2/YOUR_LAUNCHER_2.sh YOUR_APP2_PARAM_1 YOUR_APP2_PARAM_2 ...\n  redirect_stderr=true",

What are the advantages and disadvantages of each one of them? Well, it really depends on the power of the machine, the nature of your application and the load expected. In general, having all the services running in one machine will reduce its performance and scalability, but on the other hand, makes it easier the process of installation, configuration and launching.\n\n\nIf you are deploying with these instructions for the first time, we recommend using only one machine. When you verify that everything is working as expected, you can try different configurations to compare overall performance and load capacity.\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nApp, OpenVidu Server and KMS run in the same machine\n\n      \nApp runs in its own machine.

            "text": "Troubleshooting and FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Everything looks alright, but I cannot see any remote video\n\n\nYou have an app that uses OpenVidu to stream some video user-to-user, and the process looks perfectly okey. No errors on the console and all the OpenVidu events you are subscribed to are correctly triggered. So what's happening?\n\n\n99% of the time this is a problem related with \nOPENVIDU SERVER NOT HAVING A PUBLIC IP\n. To learn more about it, you can check \nthis FAQ\n. The quickest solution to this problem is to deploy in Amazon our ready-to-use OpenVidu Server with \nCloudFormation\n.\n\n\nIf you are a bit reluctant to this quick solution with Amazon CloudFormation, you can always deploy OpenVidu by yourself in Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04. Check \nDeploying OpenVidu as a native service\n section to learn how to properly do it.\n\n\nBesides that, these are the recommended steps to follow when videos are not received:\n\n\n\n\nAccess your OpenVidu dashboard (\nhttps://YOUR_OPENVIDU_IP:8443\n) to quickly test the video transmission.\n\n\nPlease be sure that your OpenVidu Server host meets the \nnetwork requirements\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe other 1% of the time this can be an attempt of \naccessing the same camera from two different browsers at the same time\n. Remember that Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari and Edge are distinct processes which cannot generally access the same physical resource (as a webcam) at the same time on your computer. On the other hand, accessing the camera from different tabs of the same browser is tipically possible.\n\n\n2. Any tips to make easier the development of my app with OpenVidu?\n\n\nYou can do some things to improve your efficiency while using OpenVidu:\n\n\n\n\nMultiple tabs to test the video transmission\n\n\nYou can use multiple tabs in the same browser to test your video streams.\n\n\nWARNING\n: you may have trouble for testing with tabs from different browsers the same time, as they compete for the camera access.\n\n\n\n\nBe very aware of the browser's console\n\n\nThere you can find logs reporting important stuff. Error messages can help you to solve many issues.\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nOpenVidu Browser is developed with both \nChrome\n (first image) and \nFirefox\n (second image) in mind in terms of logging. By default the browser's console displays OpenVidu's high-level messages (that's when the option 'Info' is enabled, as seen in the images). This means logs about OpenVidu objects being created and destroyed and logs for each triggered event (only for those you are subscribed to).\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nWarn and Error messages are specifically reserved for unwanted situations, and you should check your code in case you spot one of them.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nIf you enable the lowest level of logging you can see all the messages concerning the WebRTC negotiation process (generally not very interesting for an OpenVidu user).\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember the browser's cache\n\n\nIf you have changed your HTML, JavaScript or CSS code, refreshed the page and cannot see the changes on the browser, probably the cache is still serving the old files. To perform a hard reload of your page on the browser, press \nCtrl + Shift + R\n\n\n\n\nUse \nNgrok\n to share your app\n\n\nDo you want to be able to publish your development app over your network or even the Internet, without really having to deploy it in a server? This can be very helpful, as you can test with different devices and browsers at the same time. To achieve this, you can use \nNgrok\n. The set up is quite simple:\n\n\n\n\nDownload \nNgrok\n with this link [\nLINK\n] and unzip it.\n\n\nDownload this \nNgrok\n configuration file (named \nngrok.yml\n) from our GitHub repo \n[\nLINK\n]\n and place it in the same path as \nNgrok\n binary.\n\n\nRun \nNgrok\n with this command: \n./ngrok start --all -config=ngrok.yml\n. You will get two public IPs (ended with \n.ngrok.io\n) publishing your local address \nlocalhost:5000\n and \nlocalhost:3000\n.\n\n\nYou just have to run you app at port \n3000\n and run OpenVidu Server locally adding this parameter:\n\n\nWhen running OpenVidu Server as a Docker container: \n-Dspring.profiles.active=ngrok\n\n\nWhen running OpenVidu Server as a JAR: \n-e spring.profiles.active=ngrok\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's it! Now you can connect to your app through the \nNgrok\n public IP and the connection to OpenVidu Server will work just fine. You have \"deployed\" your app on your own computer, and cross-device testing through your own network is now possible. Connecting to your app over the Internet is also possible, but the video transmission may not work (check \nthis FAQ\n to learn why).\n\n\n\n\n3. I am using Windows to run the tutorials / develop my app. Anything I should know?\n\n\nYes, some little changes are needed because of the way Docker runs on Windows. In Linux/Mac, Docker containers are easily accesible through \nlocalhost\n, but in Windows you will have to use the specific IP allocated to your container (usually \n192.168.99.100\n). When running any tutorial or developing any application, depending if it is \nClient-Side Only\n or \nClient-Side + Server-Side\n:\n\n\nClient-Side Only\n\n\n(Tutorials \nopenvidu-hello-world\n, \nopenvidu-insecure-js\n, \nopenvidu-insecure-angular\n, \nopenvidu-getaroom\n)\n\n\nWhen initializing your Session object, change \nlocation.hostname\n to the IP of the Docker container running openvidu-server (usually \n192.168.99.100\n). For example:\n\n\nOV.initSession('wss://' + location.hostname + ':8443/' + ...\n\n\n\nin Windows is...\n\n\nOV.initSession('wss://192.168.99.100:8443/' + ...\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso you will need to serve your apps over \nhttps\n. Browsers only accept camera usage on http when the address is \nlocalhost\n, and here it will be \n192.168.99.100\n or the one that Docker picks up for you. To serve over https with \nhttp-server\n, generate a self-signed certificate and run with \n-S\n flag on the root path of your app:\n\n\nGenerate a selfsigned certificate (run in  your Docker console)\n\n\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -subj '/CN=www.mydom.com/O=My Company LTD./C=US' -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem\n\n\nRun with SSL flag\n\n\nhttp-server -S\n\n\n\n\nClient-Side + Server-Side\n\n\nJust need to add a new parameter when launching you openvidu-server container and your tutorial/app:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopenvidu/openvidu-server-kms Docker container\n (See \nDockerHub\n): override the default value of the property \nopenvidu.publicurl\n:\n\n\ndocker run -p 8443:8443 --rm -e KMS_STUN_IP=stun.l.google.com -e KMS_STUN_PORT=19302 -e openvidu.secret=MY_SECRET openvidu/openvidu-server-kms\n\n\n\nin Windows is...\n\n\ndocker run -p 8443:8443 --rm -e KMS_STUN_IP=stun.l.google.com -e KMS_STUN_PORT=19302 -e openvidu.secret=MY_SECRET -e openvidu.publicurl=https://192.168.99.100:8443/ openvidu/openvidu-server-kms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJava tutorials\n (tutorials \nopenvidu-js-java\n, \nopenvidu-mvc-java\n): override the default value of the property \nopenvidu.url\n:\n\n\nmvn package exec:java\n\n\n\nin Windows is...\n\n\nmvn -Dopenvidu.url=https://192.168.99.100:8443/ package exec:java\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we are simply changing the param \nurlOpenViduServer\n that our OpenVidu object from \nopenvidu-java-client\n will receive in \nits constructor\n. This change is something related to these specific applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode tutorials\n (tutorials \nopenvidu-js-node\n, \nopenvidu-mvc-node\n): change the URL param passed on launch:\n\n\nnode server.js https://localhost:8443/ MY_SECRET\n\n\n\nin Windows is...\n\n\nnode server.js https://192.168.99.100:8443/ MY_SECRET\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we are simply changing the param \nurlOpenViduServer\n that our OpenVidu object from \nopenvidu-node-client\n will receive in \nits constructor\n. This change is something related to these specific applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Why does my app need a server-side?\n\n\nFirst of all, let's differentiate between OpenVidu server-side and your application's server-side. \n\n\n\n\nYou will always need OpenVidu Server deployed at some place on the Internet (check the \nDeployment section\n to learn how to do it in 5 minutes). For now, OpenVidu doesn't support p2p direct connections between two users, so all the traffic must flow to OpenVidu Server or from OpenVidu Server.\n\n\nYou will generally want your application to have its own server-side. Why?\n\n\n\n\nWell, it is really not necessary. You can have a pure client-side application if you want. Just check any of these tutorials:\nopenvidu-hello-world\n, \nopenvidu-insecure-js\n, \nopenvidu-getaroom\n\n\nThe problem here is pretty evident: if you don't have any kind of server side to control your users, anyone can use your app. In fact, you can respectively see \nhere\n, \nhere\n and \nhere\n that when initializing the Session object, the SECRET is hardcoded in the JavaScript file. That means that any user with basic knowledge can get your SECRET just by looking at the source code in the browser.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n: Do NOT include your SECRET in your JavaScript or HTML files in a production environment!\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nFirst an OpenVidu app Client-Side Only.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nSecond an OpenVidu app Client-Side + Server-Side.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nIn production you will usually want the second option to avoid unwanted users.\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n5. What are the differences related to OpenVidu between an app without a server-side and an app with a server-side?\n\n\nOpenVidu works pretty much the same way, but the process you will follow for connecting to a session is a little bit different:\n\n\nWhen you have a server-side, your server may ask OpenVidu Server for a \nsessionId\n and a \ntoken\n: the first one will give you the session and the second one will connect the user to it.\n\n\nWhen you don't have a server side, the \nsessionId\n must be built in your JavaScript code in the browser, indicating your OpenVidu Server IP, the identifier of the session and your OpenVidu Server secret. Besides, the \ntoken\n param is now completely irrelevant.\n\n\nSo for initializing and connecting to a session:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu app without a server-side\n\n\nvar OPENVIDU_IP = \"my.domain.com\"\nvar OPENVIDU_SECRET = \"MY_SECRET\";\nvar SESSION_ID = \"MY_SESSION\";\n\nvar OV = new OpenVidu();\nvar session = OV.initSession(\"wss://\" + OPENVIDU_IP + \":8443/\" + SESSION_ID + \"?secret=\" + OPENVIDU_SECRET);\n\nsession.connect(null, function() { ... });\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu app with a server-side\n\n\n// Return a sessionId and a token from your server...\n\nvar OV = new OpenVidu();\nvar session = OV.initSession(sessionId)\n\nsession.connect(token, function() { ... });\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get a sessionId and a token from OpenVidu Server, you can make use of the \nREST API\n, \nopenvidu-java-client\n or \nopenvidu-node-client\n\n\n\n\n6. The CloudFormation Stack is a nice option for Amazon, but I don't like it. I want more control\n\n\nYou can always deploy everything by yourself. To do so, check \nDeploying OpenVidu as a native service\n section. It is very important to understand all the posibilities you have available regarding to the architecture of your system: you can have everything running in the same host or split the services between two or even more machines. That's up to you.\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nApp, OpenVidu Server and KMS run in the same machine\n\n      \nApp runs in its own machine. OpenVidu Server and KMS run in the same machine\n\n      \nApp, OpenVidu Server and KMS all run in different machines\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn this diagram \nSTUN/TURN server\n is not outlined. It is another necessary service, and it can be hosted wherever you want (we recommend running it in the same host as Kurento Media Server).\n\n\n7. What are STUN and TURN servers and why do I need them?\n\n\nIf the user's devices don't have a public and reachable IP, WebRTC connections cannot be established and therefore, video streams cannot be sent or received. This occurs when the users are behind NAT's and Firewalls. In brief, when they are hidden under complex networks.\n\n\nIn order to support these circumstances, WebRTC relies on \nSTUN and TURN\n servers:\n\n\n\n\nSTUN\n can easily provide to the user's devices their own public IP (the IP that other devices on the Internet use to connect to it), so they can tell OpenVidu where to send the video streams. Only with a STUN server, around \n86%\n of the time the connection will be successful.\n\n\nTURN\n is an extension of STUN, and covers the most extreme cases of complex networks (symmetric NATs). It acts as a gateway, passing all the media streams form one side to the other. This situation will occur with a probability of around \n8%\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor all purposes, OpenVidu Server acts as a final user, and your connections may fail if it is hosted behind a complex network. To provide a a solid service you definitely need both STUN and TURN servers. There are many public, free-to-use STUN servers (\nSTUN server list\n), but because TURN always faces a much larger load when coming into play, no one offers it free of charge. The good news is that it is very easy to install a COTURN server, which offers both STUN and TURN:\n\n\n\n\nOur ready-to-use \nCloudFormation stack\n already includes a properly configured COTURN server.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are deploying OpenVidu Server by your own, there are detailed instructions in the \nDeploying OpenVidu as a native service\n section, which explains how to install, configure and run COTURN in Ubuntu.\n\n\n\n\nYou can test your \nCOTURN\n server on this website: \nTrickle ICE\n. To do so, remove the default Google server from the list and add your own following this format: \nturn:YOUR_TURN_IP:YOUR_TURN_PORT\n (add your TURN username and password below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. What does OpenVidu not integrate regarding WebRTC and Kurento yet?\n\n\nAs the main goal OpenVidu has is to make as simple as possible the integration of video-call capabilities in applications, it would make little sense to support all the features provided by Kurento: why would most of developers want visual recognition or augmented reality capabilities when adding video-calls to their apps?\n\n\nBut there's also a bunch of features supported by Kurento or WebRTC that will be part of OpenVidu as well:\n\n\n\n\nVideo composing\n: right now OpenVidu streams are always sent and received without any processing in Kurento Media Server, so every subscription to a video stream in a video-session implies its own WebRTC connection. We intend to provide the possibility of configuring video-sessions to be processed and send as only one video, composed in a grid by all the published streams.\n\n\nDirect p2p connections betwwen users\n: OpenVidu will offer the possibility of connecting users without having to use Kurento Media Server as central node. This can be very advantegeous for certain use-cases, as will reduce the need of infraestructure.\n\n\nVideo recording\n: OpenVidu will support multiple (grid) and single stream recording, so developers can easily access video files later.\n\n\nScreen share\n: OpenVidu will support screen sharing.\n\n\nMobile platforms\n: OpenVIdu will provide clients for both Android and iOS.\n\n\n\n\n9. Does OpenVidu support Android and iOS?\n\n\nAt the moment there are no OpenVidu clients for mobile platforms, but we are working on it. In the future you will have available \nOpenVidu Android\n and \nOpenVidu iOS\n, joining \nOpenVidu Browser\n. The main goal here is that all of them are fully compatible with one another.\n\n\n10. Which is the current status of OpenVidu on scalability and fault tolerance?\n\n\nThis particular point relies on Kurento Media Server performance, as it is the media server used by OpenVidu. \nTestRTC\n published on September 13, 2017 a very interesting article describing in detail the behaviour of Kurento Media Server while holding a different number of video-sessions. \nHere\n is the complete article.\n\n\nThese are the conclusions for a machine with \n8 cores and 15 GB of RAM\n. The upper limit where the following scenarios guaranteed good quality of service are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario\n\n\nSize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1:1 video calls\n\n\n18 users in 9 parallel sessions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4-way group video calls (grid composing)\n\n\n3 rooms of 4 users each\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1:N broadcast\n\n\n1 broadcaster + 80-150 viewers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, one of the most important features OpenVidu will offer is the possibility of automated scalability and fault tolerance. We intend to provide an easy-to-use service integrated with Amazon Web Services to allow the automated launching and shutdown of servers depending on the workload of your application.\n\n\n11. I am getting an \"Error accesing the camera\" and I have already granted permissions on the browser\n\n\nIf you are using \nChrome\n: you \ncannot access the camera or microphone from a \nhttp\n URL if it is not \nlocalhost\n or \n127.0.0.1\n. In a nutshell: in Chrome accessing the webcam on \nhttp://localhost:8080\n or \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8080\n is perfectly OK. But, for example, on \nhttp://172.17.0.1:8080\n it will through an error saying \"\nOnly secure origins are allowed\n\". If for any reason you want to serve your app locally on a custom URL, the only solution is to serve it over \nhttps\n with a certificate. If you are making use of the web server we have strongly suggested over the documentation (\nnpm install -g http-server\n), you can do this with the following commands on your application's root path:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a selfsigned certificate with \nopenssl\n\n\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -subj '/CN=www.mydom.com/O=My Company LTD./C=US' -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \nhttp-server\n with SSL flag\n\n\nhttp-server -S",

This can be very helpful, as you can test with different devices and browsers at the same time. To achieve this, you can use  Ngrok . The set up is quite simple:   Download  Ngrok  with this link [ LINK ] and unzip it.  Download this  Ngrok  configuration file (named  ngrok.yml ) from our GitHub repo  [ LINK ]  and place it in the same path as  Ngrok  binary.  Run  Ngrok  with this command:  ./ngrok start --all -config=ngrok.yml . You will get two public IPs (ended with  .ngrok.io ) publishing your local address  localhost:5000  and  localhost:3000 .

TestRTC  published on September 13, 2017 a very interesting article describing in detail the behaviour of Kurento Media Server while holding a different number of video-sessions.  Here  is the complete article.  These are the conclusions for a machine with  8 cores and 15 GB of RAM . The upper limit where the following scenarios guaranteed good quality of service are:     Scenario  Size      1:1 video calls  18 users in 9 parallel sessions    4-way group video calls (grid composing)  3 rooms of 4 users each    1:N broadcast  1 broadcaster + 80-150 viewers     That said, one of the most important features OpenVidu will offer is the possibility of automated scalability and fault tolerance. We intend to provide an easy-to-use service integrated with Amazon Web Services to allow the automated launching and shutdown of servers depending on the workload of your application.",
