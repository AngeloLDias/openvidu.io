<h3 id="1-everything-looks-alright-but-i-cannot-see-any-remote-video">1. Everything looks alright, but I cannot see any remote video</h3>
<p>You have an app that uses OpenVidu to stream some video user-to-user, and the process looks perfectly okey. No errors on the console and all the OpenVidu events you are subscribed to are correctly triggered. So what's happening?</p>
<p>99% of the time this is a problem related with <strong>OPENVIDU SERVER NOT HAVING A PUBLIC IP</strong>. To learn more about it, you can check <a href="#6-what-are-stun-and-turn-servers-and-why-do-i-need-them">this FAQ</a>. The quickest solution to this problem is to deploy in Amazon our ready-to-use OpenVidu Server with <a href="../deployment/deploying-aws/#deploying-openvidu-server-on-aws-with-cloud-formation">CloudFormation</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a bit reluctant to this quick solution with Amazon CloudFormation, you can always deploy OpenVidu by yourself in Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04. Check <a href="../deployment/deploying-ubuntu/">Deploying OpenVidu as a native service</a> section to learn how to properly do it.</p>
<p>Besides that, these are the recommended steps to follow when videos are not received:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access your OpenVidu dashboard (<code>https://YOUR_OPENVIDU_IP:8443</code>) to quickly test the video transmission.</li>
<li>Please be sure that your OpenVidu Server host meets the <a href="../deployment/deploying-ubuntu#server-network-requirements">network requirements</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-any-tips-to-make-easier-the-development-of-my-app-with-openvidu">2. Any tips to make easier the development of my app with OpenVidu?</h3>
<p>You can do some things to improve your efficiency while using OpenVidu:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can test the video transmision between multiple tabs in the same browser. <strong>WARNING:</strong> You may have trouble for testing at the same time with a Chrome and a Firefox tab, as they compete for the camera access.</li>
<li>Be very aware of the browser's console. There you will find warning messages reporting the triggering of events and other important stuff. Error messages can also help you to solve many issues.</li>
<li>Do you want to be able to publish your development app over your network or even the Internet, without really having to deploy it in a server? This can be very helpful, as you can test with different devices and browsers at the same time. NGROK</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-why-does-my-app-need-a-server-side">3. Why does my app need a server-side?</h3>
<p>First of all, let's differentiate between OpenVidu server-side and your application's server-side. </p>
<ul>
<li>You will always need OpenVidu Server deployed at some place on the Internet (check the <a href="../deployment/deploying-aws/">Deployment section</a> to learn how to do it in 5 minutes). For now, OpenVidu doesn't support p2p direct connections between two users, so all the traffic must flow to OpenVidu Server or from OpenVidu Server.</li>
<li>You will generally want your application to have its own server-side. Why?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, it is really not necessary. You can have a pure client-side application if you want. Just check any of these tutorials:<br><a href="../tutorials/openvidu-insecure-js/">openvidu-insecure-js</a>, <a href="../tutorials/openvidu-getaroom/">openvidu-getaroom</a></p>
<p>The problem here is pretty evident: if you don't have any kind of server side to control your users, anyone can use your app. In fact, you can respectively see <a href="https://github.com/OpenVidu/openvidu-tutorials/blob/5049635370ab4d6abc95a7caccd95965a939fb1e/openvidu-insecure-js/web/app.js#L19">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OpenVidu/openvidu-tutorials/blob/5049635370ab4d6abc95a7caccd95965a939fb1e/openvidu-getaroom/web/app.js#L46">here</a> that when initializing the Session object, the SECRET is hardcoded in the JavaScript file. That means that any user with basic knowledge can get your SECRET just by looking at the source code in the browser.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Do NOT include your SECRET in your JavaScript or HTML files in a production environment!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="4-what-are-the-differences-related-to-openvidu-between-an-app-without-a-server-side-and-an-app-with-a-server-side">4. What are the differences related to OpenVidu between an app without a server-side and an app with a server-side?</h3>
<p>OpenVidu works pretty much the same way, but the process you will follow for connecting to a session is a little bit different:</p>
<p>When you have a server-side, your server may ask OpenVidu Server for a <code>sessionId</code> and a <code>token</code>: the first one will give you the session and the second one will connect the user to it. </p>
<p>When you don't have a server side, the <code>sessionId</code> must be built in your JavaScript code in the browser, indicating your OpenVidu Server IP, the identifier of the session and your OpenVidu Server secret. Besides, the <code>token</code> param is now completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>So for initializing and connecting to a session:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>OpenVidu app without a server-side</strong></p>
<pre><code>var OPENVIDU_IP = "my.domain.com"
var OPENVIDU_SECRET = "MY_SECRET";
var SESSION_ID = "MY_SESSION";

var OV = new OpenVidu();
var session = OV.initSession("wss://" + OPENVIDU_IP + ":8443/" + SESSION_ID + "?secret=" + OPENVIDU_SECRET);

session.connect(null, function() { ... });
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OpenVidu app with a server-side</strong></p>
<pre><code>// Return a sessionId and a token from your server...

var OV = new OpenVidu();
var session = OV.initSession(sessionId)

session.connect(token, function() { ... });
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>To get a sessionId and a token from OpenVidu Server, you can make use of the <a href="../reference-docs/REST-API/">REST API</a>, <a href="../reference-docs/openvidu-java-client/">openvidu-java-client</a> or <a href="../reference-docs/openvidu-node-client/">openvidu-node-client</a></p>

<p>You can always deploy everything by yourself. To do so, check <a href="../deployment/deploying-ubuntu/">Deploying OpenVidu as a native service</a> section. It is very important to understand all the posibilities you have available regarding to the architecture of your system: you can have everything running in the same host or split the services between two or even more machines. That's up to you.</p>

<p>In this diagram <a href="#6-what-are-stun-and-turn-servers-and-why-do-i-need-them">STUN/TURN server</a> is not outlined. It is another necessary service, and it can be hosted wherever you want (we recommend running it in the same host as Kurento Media Server).</p>
<h3 id="6-what-are-stun-and-turn-servers-and-why-do-i-need-them">6. What are STUN and TURN servers and why do I need them?</h3>
<p>If the user's devices don't have a public and reachable IP, WebRTC connections cannot be established and therefore, video streams cannot be sent or received. This occurs when the users are behind NAT's and Firewalls. In brief, when they are hidden under complex networks.</p>
<p>In order to support these circumstances, WebRTC relies on <strong>STUN and TURN</strong> servers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>STUN</strong> can easily provide to the user's devices their own public IP (the IP that other devices on the Internet use to connect to it), so they can tell OpenVidu where to send the video streams. Only with a STUN server, around <strong>86%</strong> of the time the connection will be successful.</li>
<li><strong>TURN</strong> is an extension of STUN, and covers the most extreme cases where both sides of the connection are hidden behind complex networks. It acts as a gateway, passing all the media streams form one side to the other. This situation will occur with a probability of around <strong>8%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all purposes, OpenVidu Server acts as a final user, and your connections may fail if it is hosted behind a complex network. To provide a a solid service you definitely need both STUN and TURN servers. There are many public, free-to-use STUN servers (<a href="https://gist.github.com/zziuni/3741933">STUN server list</a>), but because TURN always faces a much larger load when coming into play, no one offers it free of charge. The good news is that it is very easy to install a COTURN server, which offers both STUN and TURN:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our ready-to-use <a href="../deployment/deploying-aws/#deploying-openvidu-server-on-aws-with-cloud-formation">CloudFormation stack</a> already includes a properly configured COTURN server.</li>
<li>
<p>If you are deploying OpenVidu Server by your own, there are detailed instructions in the <a href="../deployment/deploying-ubuntu/">Deploying OpenVidu as a native service</a> section, which explains how to install, configure and run COTURN in Ubuntu.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can test your <em>COTURN</em> server on this website: <a href="https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/">Trickle ICE</a>. To do so, remove the default Google server from the list and add your own following this format: <code>turn:YOUR_TURN_IP:YOUR_TURN_PORT</code> (add your TURN username and password below)</p>
