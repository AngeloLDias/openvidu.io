                <b>OpenVidu Community</b> has an
                enterprise friendly Apache 2 open source license. You can deploy it anywhere (in a cloud
                provider or on premises) and make modifications on your own to adapt the software to your
                needs. <b>It is completely FREE (<a

                        in beer and as in speech</a>)!!</b><br><br>

                <b>OpenVidu Pro</b> is the commercial version of
                OpenVidu Community with enterprise features like scalability, advanced monitoring, and
                much more. Take a look to comparison table above to see the differences between versions.
                You can build an application using OpenVidu Community and, if you need it, you can purchase an OpenVidu
                Pro license and start using it without any change in your code.<br><br>

                OpenVidu Pro can also be deployed in <a
                    href="/docs/openvidu-pro/deploying-openvidu-pro#deploying-openvidu-pro-on-aws" target="_blank">a cloud
                    provider</a> or <a
                    href="/docs/openvidu-pro/deploying-openvidu-pro#deploying-openvidu-pro-on-premise" target="_blank">on
                    premises</a>.
                OpenVidu Pro is not offered as a hosted service right now. <br><br>

                OpenVidu Pro license price is proportional to the &ldquo;size&rdquo; of
                the cluster in which it is deployed. In that way, a small cluster will hold less media sessions
                and will be cheaper than a bigger cluster that manages much more media sessions.<br><br>

                OpenVidu Pro is deployed in a master-worker setup (take a look to its
                <a href="/docs/openvidu-pro/scalability/#openvidu-pro-architecture" target="_blank">architecture</a>).
                Master node executes
                OpenVidu-Server and worker nodes execute all media related services (SFU, MCU and recording
                process). We call worker nodes as Media Nodes. Price is based on CPU cores of Media Nodes. As an
                OpenVidu Pro cluster is elastic (Media Nodes can grow and shrink based on demand), every minute
                is charged based on how many CPU cores are being used in Media Nodes.<br><br>

                OpenVidu Pro is priced as:<br><br>

                <div style="margin: 3em; text-align: center; color: #000000;">
                    <div style="font-size: 4em;">$10/month</div>
                    <div style="font-size: 1.5em;">with 14000 minutes of cores of Media Nodes included</div>
                </div>

                <div style="margin: 3em; text-align: center; color: #000000;">
                    <div style="font-size: 4em;">$0.00071</div>
                    <div style="font-size: 1.5em;">per additional core of Media Nodes per minute</div>
                </div>

                <h3>How much a session in OpenVidu Pro costs?</h3>

                To calculate how much a session costs it is needed to consider several
                costs: OpenVidu Pro license costs, infrastructure costs and data bandwidth used. <br><br>

                As there are too much variables to be taken into account, we will analyze
                a fixed sized cluster with all sessions with the same number of participants. This is not
                realistic because OpenVidu Pro can reduce and increase the number of Media Nodes depending on
                demand. Also, we have left out recording as it could complicate too much the
                calculations.<br><br>

                Let&rsquo;s assume you have a cluster with a master node deployed in a VM
                with 2 CPUs and 4GB RAM and 2 Media Nodes with 8 CPUs and 16GB RAM each.<br><br>

                <h4>Cluster Capacity</h4>

                To know how many sessions can be handled by a cluster, it is important to know how
                many participants are in every session. To maintain calculations simple, let&rsquo;s assume that
                sessions have 7 participants each. In that case, according to <a
                    href="https://medium.com/@openvidu/openvidu-load-testing-a-systematic-study-of-openvidu-platform-performance-b1aa3c475ba9" target="_blank">performance
                    tests we executed</a>, 2 nodes with 8 CPUs and 16GB each, can manage
                up to 30 simultaneous sessions (15 in every Media Node). It is not realistic consider that the
                cluster will be using its maximum capacity 100% of the time. Different usage patterns and
                different elastic policies can lead to a different percentage of cluster usage. Let&rsquo;s
                consider that, in average, cluster is used at 50% of its capacity. Then, we assume that cluster
                handles 15 simultaneous sessions of 7 participants each.<br><br>

                <h4>Cluster Cost</h4>

                OpenVidu Pro cluster cost is calculated considering three main
                elements:<br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>License costs:</b> With 16 vCPUs in
                        total in Media Nodes, licence oost is $0.00071 x 16 = $0.01136 per minute.</li>

                    <li><b>Infrastructure costs:</b> Based on CPUs and
                        memory, master node can be deployed in a c5.large AWS EC2 instance and Media Nodes in 2 AWS
                        EC2 c5.2xlarge instances. Based on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand">AWS
                            EC2 pricing</a>, if cluster is
                        deployed in US East (Ohio) will
                        be charged as $0.085 + 2 * $0.17 = $0.76 per hour = $0.01275 per minute.</li>

                    <li><b>Data bandwidth:</b> Video calls are very
                        intensive in data bandwidth. Depending on video quality, different bandwidth is used. For
                        example, a 720p video stream consume 1.5 Mbps or more. Let&rsquo;s consider that we use 1
                        Mbps per media stream in the conference. In a session with 7 participants, OpenVidu Pro has
                        to receive 7 media streams. Also, it has to send 6 streams to every participant. That is, 6
                        x 7 = 42Mbps = 5,25MB per second = 315MB per minute of data transfer out from AWS to
                        Internet. If we consider 15 sessions, then the cluster send to participants 315MB x 15 =
                        4725MB per minute = 4,61GB per minute. Based on <a
                            href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand">AWS EC2 pricing</a></span><span>,
                            transfer from Internet to AWS is free. Data transfer out from AWS to Internet is charged
                            at $0.09 per GB with moderate bandwidth usage. As there are discounts for volume,
                            let&rsquo;s assume that cost is $0.07 per GB. Then, the cost of data bandwidth in the
                            cluster will be 4,61GB x $0.07 = $0.3227 per minute.</li>
                </ul>

                In summary, a cluster handling, in average, 15 sessions of 7 participants
                will cost $0.01136 in license + $0.01275 in infrastructure costs + $0.3227 in bandwidth =
                $0.34681 per minute.<br><br>

                <h4>Cost per participant</h4>

                The cost of every participant can be easily calculated as $0.34681 / 15 /
                7 = $0.0033 in sessions of 7 participants.

                <div style="margin: 3em; text-align: center; color: #000000;">
                    <div style="font-size: 4em;">$0.0033</div>
                    <div style="font-size: 1.5em;">per minute per participant in sessions of 7 in AWS</div>
                </div>

                It is important to remember that sessions with less participants will
                have lower cost per participant as less media streams have to be sent to participants.<br><br>

                <h4>Data transference prices and cloud providers</h4>

                As you can see, in this cluster, <b>93% of cost is due to data
                    transference</b>. For that reason, it is important to consider deploying the
                cluster in a cloud provider with low prices in data transfer. In the moment of writing this
                page, the prices for data transference in the main cloud providers are:<br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/network-pricing">Google
                            Cloud</a>: $0.12 to $0.08 per GB</li>
                    <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/es/ec2/pricing/on-demand/">AWS</a>: $0.09 to $0.05 per Gb
                        (1GB free per
                        month)</li>
                    <li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/pricing/details/bandwidth/">Azure</a>: $0.087 to
                        $0.05 per Gb
                        (5GB free per month)</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing">DigitalOcean</a>: $0.01 Gb (From 1TB to 12TB
                        free per month)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                According to these transference prices we can roughly calculate the cost
                of deploying the same cluster in DigitalOcean. Bandwidth cost will be 4,61GB x $0.01 = $0.0461
                per minute.<br><br>

                Assuming the same instance prices, the total price can be calculated as
                $0.01136 in license + $0.01275 in infrastructure costs + $0.0461 in bandwidth = $0.07021 per
                minute.<br><br>

                The cost per participant can be easily calculated as $0.07021 / 15 / 7 =
                $0.000669 per minute.

                <div style="margin: 3em; text-align: center; color: #000000;">
                    <div style="font-size: 4em;">$0.000669</div>
                    <div style="font-size: 1.5em;">per minute per participant in sessions of 7 in Digital Ocean
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Comparison with hosted alternatives</h3>

                If you are considering using a managed service to implement your
                application based on video calls, it is important to compare features and prices. Let&rsquo;s
                focus here comparing pricing of some hosted alternatives.<br><br>

                <div style="
                        display: table;
                        border: 2px solid #0088aa9e;

                            padding-left: 20px;
                            padding-right: 20px;">

                        <br>
                        <strong>NOTE</strong>: Please take into account that managed services provide stable and
                        predictable pricing in its offerings. When you operate your own infrastructure, on-premises
                        or in a cloud provider, there are a lot of things to take care and real prices can be very
                        different to estimations and studies. In any case, we can assume that our calculations are
                        reasonable and we will use them to compare OpenVidu Pro with managed services.<br><br>

                        Note that managed services can provide more features than the ones provided
                        by OpenVidu Pro. Also, OpenVidu Pro has to be operated by your operations team and managed
                        services are managed by experienced operations team and usually have SLAs to warranty
                        service
                        quality. Also, the scenario described is suitable for a medium to high number of sessions
                        and
                        participants. For only a few sessions, cluster cost can suppose a high cost. <br><br>

                </div>

                <br>

                <h4>Twilio Programmable Video</h4>

                Twilio is a great company (as you probably know, we have a lot of friends there).
                The <a href="https://www.twilio.com/video">programmable
                    video service</a> provides an API and several client SDKs to
                implement video conference applications like OpenVidu Pro.<br><br>

                According to <a href="https://www.twilio.com/video/pricing">its
                    pricing web page</a>, you can have small sessions (know as rooms) up
                to 4 participants and big sessions (up to 50 participants). In our cost study, we have
                considered sessions with 7 participants. The price of big sessions in Twilio is $0.01 per
                participant per minute. <br><br>

                Above we have calculated the cost of sessions of 7 participants
                &nbsp;with an OpenVidu Pro cluster deployed in AWS as $0.0033 per participant per minute.
                According to that, in that specific scenario, <b>OpenVidu Pro in AWS can reduce the cost in 67%
                    compared with Twilio</b>. That is, Twilio is 3 times more expensive than OpenVidu Pro in AWS.
                Moreover, if OpenVidu Pro cluster is deployed in Digital Ocean, the
                cost can be reduced 93% compared with Twilio. From other perspective, <b>Twilio is 15 times
                    more expensive than OpenVidu
                    Pro in Digital Ocean.</b> <br><br>

                <h4>Tokbox</h4>

                <a href="https://tokbox.com/">Tokbox</a> is
                also a great video service providing roughly the same features than OpenVidu Pro. According to
                <a href="https://tokbox.com/pricing">its
                    pricing web page</a>, every subscribed media stream is charged from
                $0.00475 to $0.00425 depending on volume. For our calculations, let&rsquo;s consider it is
                charged as $0.0045 per minute. As TokBox charges based on subscribed media stream, in a session
                with 7 participants, every participant will be subscribed to 6 streams, so cost per participant
                is 6 x $0.0045 = $0.027 per participant per minute. <br><br>

                Above we have calculated the cost of sessions of 7 participants with an
                OpenVidu Pro cluster deployed in AWS as $0.0033 per participant per minute. According to that,
                in that specific scenario, <b>OpenVidu Pro in AWS can reduce the cost in 87,78% compared with
                    Tokbox</b>. That
                is, Twilio is 8 times more expensive than OpenVidu Pro in AWS. Moreover, if we deploy the
                cluster in DigitalOcean, with a cost of $0.000669 per participant per minute, the cost can be
                reduced 97,52%. From other perspective, <b>Tokbox is 40 times more expensive than OpenVidu Pro in
                    Digital Ocean.</b><br><br>

                <h4>Vidyo</h4>

                <a href="https://vidyo.io/">Vidyo</a> provides a managed platform to build video streaming apps.
                Related to pricing,
                it charges 65$ per month with 6500 minutes per participant includes. More minutes are charged as
                $0.01, just like Twilio price for big rooms (more than 4 participants).<br><br>

                As the price per participant is the same than Twilio one, we can raise
                exactly the same conclusions compared with OpenVidu Pro pricing. <b>OpenVidu Pro in AWS can reduce
                    the cost in 67% compared with Vidyo</b>. That is, Vidyo is 3 times more expensive than OpenVidu
                Pro in
                AWS. The cost can be reduced 93% if OpenVidu Pro is deployed in Digital Ocean. From the other
                perspective, <b>Vidyo is 15 times more expensive than OpenVidu Pro in Digital Ocean</b>.<br><br>

                <h4>SkyLink</h4>

                <a href="https://skylink.io/">Temasys
                    SkyLink</a> is another hosted service to build video streaming
                applications. Unfortunately, there is no public pricing web page and it is needed to create one
                free account to get pricing information. Moreover, pricing details are described in such a way
                that comparison with other services is difficult. Related to media sessions, the prices are
                $0.15 per connection and $0.50 per GB of bandwidth. <br><br>

                As we have seen previously, in our scenario,
                every participant needs 6Mbps = 0.75MBps = 45MB per minute per participant of data transfer from
                server to browser. And also 1Mbps = 0.125MBps = 7.5MB per minute of data transfer from browser
                to server. That is, a total of 52,5MB per minute per participant. With a cost of $0.5 per GB =
                $0.00048 per MB, every participant costs $0.0256 per minute in data transfer. Also, as every
                connection costs $0.15 (independently of the session duration), it is needed to define session
                duration. Let&rsquo;s consider that session duration is, in average, 30 minutes of duration.
                Then, every minute, every participant can be charged $0.15 for 1/30 connections = $0.005 per
                minute per participant in connection fee. In total, every participant will cost $0.0256 in data
                transfer plus $0.005 in connection cost, that is $0.0306 per participant per minute. <br><br>

                Above we have calculated the cost of sessions of 7 participants with an
                OpenVidu Pro cluster deployed in AWS as $0.0033 per participant per minute. According to that,
                in that specific scenario, <b>OpenVidu Pro in AWS can reduce the cost in 89,22% compared with
                    SkyLink</b>.
                That is, SkyLink is 9 times more expensive than OpenVidu Pro in AWS. Moreover, if we deploy the
                cluster in DigitalOcean, with a cost of $0.000669 per participant per minute, the cost can be
                reduced 97,81%. From other perspective, <b>SkyLink is 46 times more expensive than OpenVidu Pro in
                    Digital Ocean.</b><br><br>

                <h4>Summary</h4>

                The following table and chart summarize the prices of the different alternatives
                to build video conference applications with an average of 15 simultaneous sessions of 30 minutes
                of duration and 7 participants each.<br><br>
